Addressing an event at the Rajiv Gandhi Health University in Bengaluru via video conference, Modi said, “The virus may be an invisible enemy. But our warriors, medical workers are invincible. In the battle of Invisible vs Invincible, our medical workers are sure to win.” He also said that the world is looking at them with gratitude, hope, and seeks both ‘care’ and ‘cure’. “At the root of India’s brave fight against COVID-19 is the hard work of the medical community and our corona warriors. In fact, doctors and medical workers are like soldiers, but without the soldiers’ uniforms,” he added. During the address, PM Modi also stressed that violence against COVID warriors will not be tolerated. “I want to state it clearly- violence, abuse and rude behaviour against front-line workers is not acceptable,” he said, during the inauguration of silver jubilee celebrations of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences.",

A senior police officer and highly placed sources said 20 people died in the stampede that occurred at 7 pm when platforms no. 5 and 6 were packed with thousands of passengers. Eyewitnesses said the stampede was triggered when the railing leading to the foot overbridge over platform no. 6 collapsed when several passengers rushed to board a train. They said there was a sudden surge of passengers after an announcement over the public address system about the arrival of a train. The platform no. 6 was sealed by authorities. There were reports of a lathi charge which compounded the tragedy. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condoled loss of lives and instructed railway ministry to provide all possible assistance. The UP government ordered an inquiry and asked the railways to make proper arrangements to clear rush of devotees.

The stampede occurred at 7 pm when platform no 5 and 6 were packed with thousands of passengers. Eyewitnesses said the stampede was triggered when the railing leading to the foot overbridge over platform no 6 collapsed, when hundreds of passengers rushed to board a train. Three hours after the mishap, bodies of 20 victims were lying on the platform. They said there was a sudden surge of passengers after an announcement over the public address system about the arrival of a train. Platform no 6 was sealed by authorities. Eyewitnesses claimed there was a lathi charge by the police, but Rao said the incident happened when passengers were being told to stand in a line to bring the movement of the crowd under control. The injured have been rushed to various hospitals. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condoled loss of lives in the tragedy and instructed ministry of railways to provide all possible assistance. Singh also directed central government departments to extend all possible help to the Uttar Pradesh government in relief operations.

The stampede was caused after railing of an over bridge at the railway station collapsed. Officials, however, are yet to confirm the death toll. Akhilesh Yadav announced a committee which will probe into the incident. \"We will investigate whether guidelines for managing the crowd was followed on the big day of Mauni Amavasya Snaan,\" said the state government in a statement. It also added that clear directions were given to local authorities that they should ensure that large number of people do not gather at one place. According to the initial reports, over two lakh people were present at the railway station when the stampede took place. Over three crore people gathered in Allahabad on Sunday to take a holy dip on the occasion of 'Mauni Amavasya' - considered the most auspicious day during the 12-yearly congregation. \"As per our estimates, three crore people have taken a holy dip till 3 pm. The influx of visitors has slowed down a bit since then but the turn-out has already exceeded our expectations,\" Kumbh Mela Officer Mani Prasad Mishra had said earlier in the day. Through the day devotees kept surging towards Sangam - the confluence of the holy rivers Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati - while the 13 'akharas' (sects) of sadhus took out their processions for the second 'Shahi Snan' (royal bath) during the Maha Kumbh. Amid chants of 'Har Har Gange', devotees including a fair sprinkling of foreigners, watched awestruck as 'naga sadhus' with their matted hair, ash-smeared naked bodies adorned with garlands of marigold and 'rudraksh' moved in processions with their 'Shri Mahants' and 'Mahamandaleshwars' (seers) perched atop decorated chariots, horses and elephants. A number of VIPs, including political heavyweights, film stars and business tycoons have visited the Kumbh over the past few weeks. However, the administration had banned any film promotional activity in the Kumbh area to prevent any situation which could lead to a stampede. The ritual of bathing started on Saturday afternoon itself when 'Mauni Amavasya' began according to the Hindu almanac and reached its crescendo on Sunday morning. A steady stream of devotees was seen at railway stations and bus stations where people from nearby as well as far-off places took to roads and pathways all of which seemed to be leading towards the Sangam on this day. A railway station in the neighbouring district of Pratapgarh was vandalised on Sunday morning by people angry over non-availability of a special train for a trip to the holy Sangam. Tight security arrangements were in place with more than 15,000 security personnel drawn from central paramilitary forces like ITBP, CRPF, BSF and RAF besides the Uttar Police and its Provincial Armed Constabulary and Anti-Terrorist Squad keeping a close vigil. Besides, the Army conducted aerial surveys every few minutes.",

Too often, he remarked, do we judge others by their worst actions and ourselves by our best principles. This double standard, often adopted without due self-awareness of it, is worth a mull-over in various contexts today. In the context of India’s religious diversity and the social dynamics thereof, for example, Mahatma Gandhi’s caution should apply to all public discourse on the issue of Khalistan. Links of this fringe separatist drive with terrorism do have a past record, as New Delhi’s spat with Ottawa reminded us, but care must be taken that the Sikh faith and community are not cast in negative light. Since the risk of this has heightened, all deliberations on separatist violence demand reiteration by our leaders and diplomats, both globally and within India, that Indian statehood is not founded on religious belief. As the language deployed tends to encode signals of inclusion and exclusion, statistically invalid conflations of terror with any group of people must be eschewed. Let principles predominate.",

On a base that covid shrank by 6.6% in 2020-21, it would still mean an economy a slight bit larger than its pre-pandemic size in real terms. This is a relief in itself.

With two years lost to the pandemic, we need to clamber onto a rapid-growth trajectory again. This calls for a spring-back not just from covid, but also from a slump that began about five years ago and led to sub-4% expansion in 2019-20. While a big fiscal and monetary push has been made, we also face the adverse after-effects of relief measures taken globally. We may not be headed for stagflation, but price instability is a big threat and lending rates may need to rise sharply.

As chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological mentor of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, he endorsed the value of unity in diversity, as also the validity of various paths of faith, including Islam, and asked for a dial-down of disputes over places of worship to lay out a case for global guruhood based on humanist Hindu ideals aided by state power. A war-torn world, in his view, had made space for a pluralist pax-Sanatana of dharmic truth. This address of 2 June was significant in our home context of Hindu-Muslim tension not just for its Gyanvapi nudge towards either talks or the law but for sensitivity to the broader flashpoint potential in today’s schism. While its Muslim outreach alluded to an asymmetry of threats, in clarifying that the Sangh was not opposed to non-Hindu forms of devotion, it held out an implicit promise to support freedom of religion. Living up to our Constitution on this crucial point would reduce misgivings and thus also the risk of conch shells being misheard by members of a minority group with little political voice left.",

We did rather poorly on climate policy, mostly with carbon emissions to blame. As is its wont, the government may be tempted to reject these findings as flawed.

    "article_text": "Within hours of the massacre of Israeli citizens by Hamas fighters last Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted India’s solidarity with Israel. While the histories of their conflicts and the scale of violence have been very different, India has faced terror attacks all too often to not feel the pain in Israel where teenagers at a concert, children in a park, grandparents at home, and even babies in cribs were gunned down, amidst other atrocities Hamas carried out, including taking dozens hostage. The sentiments were repeated when Mr. Modi spoke to Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, condemning terrorism in all its forms. India’s second big concern has been the safety of its citizens, especially as Israel began retaliatory strikes on Gaza. Around 18,000 Indians work or study in Israel, in addition to about 85,000 Israelis of Indian origin (from Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Kerala, and West Bengal). The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has chartered flights to bring them home. New Delhi has also added nuance to the initial position, with the MEA delivering the government’s first formal statement. While repeating the condemnation of the Hamas attacks, the statement reminded Israel about the “universal obligation to observe international humanitarian law”, as it carries out “global responsibility to fight the menace of terrorism....” In addition, the MEA reiterated its “long-standing and consistent” position on the Palestine issue. The statement is a reminder of the tightrope India has walked since 1992, when New Delhi established full diplomatic ties with Israel, while continuing to support the Palestinian cause. There has been a shift towards Israel’s position, given increasingly close bilateral relations, trade, technological assistance, military procurement, and counter-terrorism cooperation. In 2017, Mr. Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel, while in 2018, Mr. Netanyahu visited India. However, Mr. Modi was also the first Indian Prime Minister to make an official visit to Palestine. In 2017, India voted against the U.S. and Israel for an attempt to declare unilaterally all of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. The policy lines New Delhi is continuing to draw seem clear: to abhor terrorism, but not to condone indiscriminate reprisal bombings, even as it holds its consistent position on Palestine. No claim to righting historical grievances can possibly be used by Hamas to explain its inhuman attacks on Israel. However, a responsible state cannot behave like an insurgent group, and Israel’s latest demand, that more than a million Gaza residents must evacuate as it continues to pound the city and plans a possible ground offensive, will make Delhi’s challenge at balancing policy even more complex.",

India’s data for May, released on Monday, puts our retail inflation at 7.04%, down modestly from April’s reading of almost 7.8%. Given our tolerance limit of 6%, it is less disastrous an overshoot than America’s, but that should not serve as a fig leaf for central bank failure. Talking about a supply shock from overseas as the sole cause of the crisis would be to wilfully ignore the inflationary impulses brought about by an unprecedented monetary and fiscal expansion in response to the covid crisis. As an extended era of cheap oil had no guarantee to begin with, the Ukraine war can at most be blamed for bringing existent risks to a head. Broadly, price stability is a function of the priority we give it. Remember, inflation is the unkindest cut of all, for it acts as a regressive tax. It mostly hurts those who have the least to get by. As it also has its set of gainers, it results in reverse redistribution—from the poor to the rich.

    "headline": "How the rupee’s slide will impact India’s economy",
    "article_text": "Multiple forces have been pulling the Indian rupee down, including the exit of foreign portfolio investors, the rising cost of international crude oil prices, and a strong dollar. Mint explains the implications of the decline in the Indian currency. How low can the rupee go? The rupee was falling till the middle of December 2021 over concerns about the economic fallout from the omicron wave, elevated crude oil prices, and expectations of quicker rate hikes by the US Fed. Subsequently, as covid cases declined, the currency showed signs of appreciation. The rupee came under pressure from late February in the wake of the war in Ukraine and the surge in crude oil prices. On 13 June, the rupee hit an all-time low of 78.29 to the dollar. Market participants expect it to trade in the range of 79-80 to a dollar going ahead, and touching 80 by the end of December. What is the impact on inflation? The Reserve Bank of India’s April monetary policy report made the assumption that the rupee will trade around 76 per dollar during FY23, adding that a 5% decline from this would raise inflation by 20 basis points. The rupee has already declined 2% from this assumption, signalling a worsening of inflation ahead. RBI said that given the high volatility in financial and commodity markets, the pass-through of currency weakness to inflation will not be linear and will vary with time. India’s inflation was earlier expected to moderate this year due to RBI’s measures, but the eroding rupee will deny this benefit. What does a weaker rupee mean for businesses? One, higher import costs. Second, Indian firms have been borrowing from the offshore dollar market, and the stock of commercial borrowing stood at $226.4 billion at the end of December 2021. Interest repayments are, therefore, expected to swell. Fund-raising through external commercial borrowing is likely to moderate too. Will current account deficit worsen? Current account deficit (CAD), or when the imports are more than exports, is expected to worsen. For a net importer like India, a weak currency isn’t good news. This worsens CAD especially at a time of heavy FPI outflows. The CAD could touch 3% of GDP (vs CAD of 1.2% in April-Dec 2021) due to higher import bills and a fall in forex reserves, since it is being used to finance the deficit. Forex reserves stood at $596.45 billion as on 10 June. However, over the next year, reserves could rise if exporters benefit from the cost advantage. What are the options before RBI? India’s central bank has been selling dollars from its reserves and buying rupee, which leads to the supply of dollar going up and that of the rupee falling. At the beginning of October, one dollar was worth a little over ₹74 and it is currently around ₹78. If RBI hadn’t intervened, dollar could have touched ₹80 already. That said, RBI cannot keep selling dollars as its forex reserves will deplete at a faster pace. Since October last year, India’s forex reserves have fallen by around $40 billion.",
    "summary": "The Indian rupee has been declining due to several factors, including the exit of foreign portfolio investors, rising international crude oil prices, and a strong US dollar. As a result, the rupee hit an all-time low of 78.29 to the dollar on June 13, and market participants expect it to trade in the range of 79-80 to a dollar, possibly reaching 80 by the end of December. The impact on inflation is significant, as a weaker rupee is expected to worsen inflation. The Reserve Bank of India assumed that the rupee would trade around 76 per dollar during FY23 and noted that a 5% decline from this level would raise inflation by 20 basis points. For businesses, a weaker rupee means higher import costs, and Indian firms that have borrowed from the offshore dollar market will face increased interest repayments. The current account deficit (CAD) is also expected to worsen due to the weak rupee, especially at a time of heavy foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows. The CAD could reach 3% of GDP, compared to 1.2% in April-December 2021. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been intervening by selling dollars from its reserves to support the rupee. However, this approach has its limits, as depleting forex reserves at a rapid pace is not sustainable. RBI will need to carefully manage its interventions to stabilize the rupee without depleting its reserves too quickly.",

    "article_text": "Urban Indian consumers reduced spending on apparel, fuel, and eating out over the last six months as inflation ate into household budgets, a YouGov survey showed. A majority of urban Indians said their cost of living has gone up to some extent as compared to 12 months ago, as prices of daily essentials rose. Among the 1,013 urban respondents polled online during 7-10 June, 46% said their cost of living has gone up “a lot” compared to 12 months ago, while 33% said it has gone up “a little”. “With inflation at its highest level in the past eight years, petrol prices spiralling and wholesale price inflation at a 30-year high, cost of living in India has gone up in the recent past,” YouGov said. Retail inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew sharply to an eight-year high of 7.79% in April, before cooling to 7.04% in May. As a result, households are trimming expenditure they deem unnecessary. Consumers in tier I cities are feeling the impact more, with half of them claiming that their cost of living has gone up a lot compared to the 44% and 43% of residents in tier II and III cities. Clothing tops the list of cutbacks, with more than a third saying they have reduced spends on apparel and accessories. Almost as many (31%) have reduced their spending on hobbies or leisure activities such as going to the cinema. With the recent rise in fuel prices, 29% claim to have cut expenses on petrol or diesel, while 28% have decreased spending on eating out. This behaviour is more pronounced in tier I cities than other cities, the survey showed. Around a quarter have cut down expenses on streaming services, but this is notably higher in tier I cities where 32% have claimed to do so in the last six months. However, consumers continued to spend on various categories such as essential food items, food deliveries, home broadband subscriptions, insurance, alcohol and tobacco and monthly mobile phone bills. Fewer cutbacks have been reported on essential food items (12%), broadband subscriptions (15%) and household essentials (18%), perhaps because these are more of a necessity, according to the survey findings. However, two in five urban Indians expect their household situation to improve in the next 12 months.A third (32%) expect no change and only 17% think it will become worse.",

    "headline": "Gig workers and the long road to employee status",
    "article_text": "Many countries are pushing digital platform companies employing gig workers to treat them as ‘employees’. Now, India’s federal think tank Niti Aayog has joined the debate, recommending social security policies for such workers. Mint explains. hat is Niti Aayog’s recommendation? The think tank has recommended that platforms or startups provide gig workers with more support in the form of pension, provident fund, paid sick leave, and medical and life insurance. It has also recommended creating a social security fund to account for injuries and emergencies. It has also suggested the government create ‘platform initiatives’—along the lines of Startup India— which will carry out a census of gig workers to survey and identify them. It wants this framework to upskill them and help them access loans with generous timelines in case of an emergency, and open credit lines for their own ventures. Why are these proposals important? The gig economy is expected to triple in size to 23.5 million workers by 2030, according to Niti Aayog’s estimates. The gig economy, therefore, can potentially alleviate unemployment, and provide opportunities to women and marginalized workers. The federal think tank also feels that the platform economy can lead to greater formalization of work. Nevertheless, there are concerns. The think tank noted that long hours and low earnings could result in exploitative work practices. The recommendations come at a time when gig workers at several platforms have protested against harsh work conditions. How are gig workers treated in other countries? Last year, the UK Supreme Court said Uber drivers are entitled to minimum wages and holiday pay. In 2020, the US Congress extended unemployment insurance to gig workers as part of covid relief steps. The US government has recommended classifying some gig workers as ‘employees’. Recently, a Swiss court ruled that Uber drivers were employees. Do startups provide any support today? Most startups provide medical, accidental or life insurance policies, but not provident fund or pension benefits. Some companies offer on-job training and benefits such as loans or scholarships for workers’ children. In some cases, a loyal gig worker, one who has spent years on a platform, may be absorbed as a permanent employee. But that’s rare. A new discussion is doing the rounds—startups contributing towards a common government corpus for workers who have been employed for a minimum amount of time.",

    "article_text": "A prominent Indo-Canadian community member has voiced deep concern over the \"ecosystem\" in Canada that has enabled Khalistan extremists to use violence, threaten and bully those opposing their \"nefarious agendas''. Amidst the diplomatic standoff between Canada and India over the killing of a pro-Khalistan separatist in Surrey in British Columbia province in June, he cautioned that political appeasement for short-term gains is not in the interest of Canada's future. \"Freedom of expression should be for everyone. We have unfortunately created that kind of ecosystem in Canada where these people are very vocal, very violent, very aggressive, and they don't let anybody.... come out against them. They will bully, they will threaten, they will use every possible illegal means... to counter any sanity,\" he said, adding that Sikhs across the US, Canada and the UK have come out and said that they don't believe or endorse the Khalistan ideology. \"These (are big issues) that worry us as Canadians, in the long-term interest of Canada. We feel worried about the future of our children, about the rifts between communities,\" he said, adding that leaders in government and officials in policy and advocacy should take up those issues for the larger interest of Canada. India and Canada are embroiled in a diplomatic standoff following allegations by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the Canadian Parliament last month that \"Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India and the killing\" of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil on June 18 in British Columbia, a charge angrily rejected by New Delhi as \"absurd\" and \"motivated\". Malik referred to the bombing of Air India Flight 182 in 1985 and said people and families of victims to date feel they have not got justice. The Montreal-Delhi Air India 'Kanishka' Flight 182 exploded 45 minutes before it was to have landed at London's Heathrow Airport on June 23, 1985, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadians of Indian descent. The bombing was blamed on Sikh militants in retaliation to the 'Operation Blue Star' to flush out militants from the Golden Temple in 1984. \"As a Canadian, I have no hesitation in admitting that we haven't been able to call out the ideology and people who were responsible for that. We've seen them flourish. We've seen them grow, that ideology has grown, got beyond control. People have suffered. Within (the) Sikh community also, there are people who've suffered because of this ideology. They have not got justice for over 40 years now,\" he said. \"This ideology has been flourishing and growing, with whatever patronage or whatever support. That is not Sikh ideology. That is not what Sikh people believe in,\" he said. He questioned what prompted Prime Minister Trudeau to conclude within four months in Nijjar's case and noted that there are diplomatic ways for countries to deal with issues behind closed doors. \"It looks to us, as Canadians, it's more like appeasement politics or a political move than anything else,\" he said, adding that the issue should have been dealt with in a different way to ensure the already strained relationship between the two countries due to the matters left unresolved for decades now, is not further spoilt. Malik added that Canada has been facing challenges, including economic recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic and cost of living. \"We need countries like India, partners like India,\" whose economies are growing, he said. \"It is in our interest as Canada, and as Canadians, to work closely with countries like India, and if there are issues, they need to be resolved in a way that it does not hamper Canadians' chances to get economic benefit from opportunities which India presents today,\" he added. \"Both these countries have a great future. People on both sides are very progressive. They want the relationship to flourish, they want exchanges to take place, students to come here, people come here to set up businesses, people to go (to India) to explore opportunities,\" he said. He added that it is important to resolve the issues, not let them escalate and to \"nip them in the bud\".",

With the Lander accomplishing a ‘soft landing’ on the Moon’s south pole, India becomes the only country to have ever done so. A rover, which is a small vehicle that is meant to move around on the Moon’s surface, then came out of the Lander. On August 24, ISRO released a video of how this happened on X. When Chandrayaan-3 took off for the Moon on July 14, we explained the basics of the mission – how a mission launches into Space, what the Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2 missions were, etc. You can click here to read it. Here, we further explain why a ‘soft landing’ was crucial to the mission, what makes landing on the south pole a difficult feat, and what is to happen after the landing. What is a soft landing, and why did Chandrayaan-3 land on the south pole? According to ISRO, the mission’s three objectives were to demonstrate a safe and soft landing on the lunar surface, to demonstrate a Rover roving on the Moon and to conduct in-situ scientific experiments. Soft landing simply means landing at a gentle, controlled speed to not sustain damage to a spacecraft. Amitabha Ghosh, a scientist for NASA’s Rover mission to Mars, explained it in The Indian Express thus: “Imagine a spacecraft hurtling through space, at 10 times the speed of an airplane, having to nearly come to a standstill in order to land gently on the Earth — all in a matter of a few minutes and, more importantly, without any human intervention. This, in a nutshell, is a soft landing.”",
    "summary": "The Chandrayaan-3 Lander carried more fuel than Chandrayaan-2. This was done to ensure that the Lander is able to make a last-minute change in its landing site if it needs to. The Chandrayaan-3 Lander has solar panels on four sides, instead of only two in Chandrayaan-2. This was to ensure that the Lander continued to draw solar power, even if it landed in a wrong direction, or tumbled over. At least one or two of its sides would always be facing the Sun, and remain active.",

    "article_text": "The results of a vaccine trial for preventing breast cancer in mice have raised hopes of finding an effective vaccine for use in humans. Breast cancer is one of the biggest killers in several countries. With nearly 100,000 new cases reported every year in India, it has overtaken cervical cancer as the number one cancer afflicting women. The results published online in the journal Nature Medicine (“An autoimmune-mediated strategy for prophylactic breast cancer vaccination,” by Ritika Jaini et al , of Cleveland Clinic, Ohio) show that none of the genetically breast cancer-prone mice vaccinated with a single dose of alpha-lactalbumin protein developed the cancer while those that received a placebo did. Except for a couple of studies, research has shown the significance of using this protein as a potential antigen for breast cancer. Alpha-lactalbumin is normally not present in non-breast human tissues. Hence to be chosen as a preventive vaccine candidate antigen to prime the immune system, the protein should satisfy certain conditions. It should be expressed by a majority of breast tumours at significant levels that allow its detection. Secondly, its production by normal breast cells should be restricted to certain easily traceable situations. In this case, alpha-lactalbumin, a lactation-dependent milk protein, is expressed only by lactating mothers. Also, there appears to be less likelihood of the prophylactic vaccine causing any harm to vaccinated women because, the authors note, the availability of the protein is “insufficient in normal non-lactating tissue.”",
    "summary": "Promising results from a mouse trial for a breast cancer vaccine have raised hopes for human use. Breast cancer is a major health concern, particularly in India. The study, published in Nature Medicine, found that mice genetically prone to breast cancer, when vaccinated with alpha-lactalbumin protein, didn't develop the cancer, unlike those given a placebo. The protein, not found in non-breast tissues, meets essential criteria for a preventive vaccine candidate. It's primarily present in lactating mothers, making it unlikely to harm non-lactating women. This development is a significant step in the quest for an effective breast cancer vaccine.",

For deciding cases questioning constitutional validity, the minimum number of judges shall be seven and the decision should be taken by a majority of two-thirds. The committee felt Article 226 gave very wide powers to high courts on writs. HCs enjoyed more powers than the SC since the latter was restricted to the enforcement of fundamental rights.

    "article_text": "JAKARTA: A large fire broke out at a fuel storage depot in Indonesia's capital on Friday, killing at least 17 people, injuring dozens of others and forcing the evacuation of thousands of nearby residents after spreading to their neighborhood, officials said. The Plumpang fuel storage station, operated by state-run oil and gas company Pertamina, is near a densely populated area in the Tanah Merah neighborhood in North Jakarta. It supplies 25% of Indonesia's fuel needs. At least 260 firefighters and 52 fire engines were struggling to contain the blaze in the nearby neighborhood, fire officials said. Video of the fire broadcast on television showed hundreds of people in the community running in panic while thick plumes of black smoke and orange flames filled the sky and firefighters battled the blaze. A preliminary investigation showed the fire broke out when a pipeline ruptured during heavy rain, possibly from a lightning strike, said Eko Kristiawan, Pertamina's area manager. He said the fire would not disrupt the country's fuel supply. Satriadi Gunawan, who heads Jakarta's fire and rescue department, said people living in the residential area were still being evacuated and were being taken to a nearby village hall and a mosque. \"The fire caused several explosions and quickly spread to residential houses,\" Gunawan said. He said at least 17 people were dead, including two children, and 50 had been hospitalized, some with severe burns. Indonesia's minister of state-owned enterprises, Erick Thohir, expressed his condolences to the victims and their families and ordered Pertamina to thoroughly investigate the fire and focus on quickly assisting the community. \"There must be an operational evaluation in the future. I'll continue to monitor this case,\" Thohir said in a video statement. Friday's fire was the second large blaze at the Plumpang fuel depot. In 2014, a fire engulfed at least 40 nearby houses but no casualties were reported. Fahmi Radhi, an energy analyst, urged Pertamina and the government to immediately move the depot away from the nearby community settlements. \"Pertamina has been negligent by not using international standard security systems,\" he said in an interview with KOMPAS TV. He said that since the 2014 fire there had been no efforts to put such a system in place and that regular inspections should be conducted to avoid future fires. \"Pertamina's board of directors should be held responsible for this deadly fire by being dismissed immediately,\" Radhi said. An oil spill in 2018 caused a fire that killed five people and sickened hundreds in the port city of Balikpapan. Authorities said it came from a broken pipe that Pertamina was using to transfer crude oil. In March 2021, a fire at Cilacap gasoline storage facility at the largest oil refinery on the main island of Java",

Chidambaram was able to keep the fiscal deficit for 2012-13 within the target he had set himself because total spending by the government was around ₹ 60,000 crore less than budgeted. One would have expected him to build on this austerity, even though it was led by curbs on capital spending rather than subsidy cuts. However, in the budget he presented on Thursday, the finance minister has indicated he will increase public spending faster than the underlying economy is expected to grow in nominal terms. There are no prizes for guessing why we have seen a strategic switch from austerity to profligacy: there is a national election due in 2014.",
    "summary": "A noteworthy paradox emerges in the fiscal strategy of Finance Minister P. Chidambaram for the year 2012-13. He managed to keep the fiscal deficit within his set target by underspending government funds by approximately ₹60,000 crore. One might have anticipated a continuation of this fiscal restraint, even though it was primarily achieved by curbing capital spending rather than reducing subsidies. However, in the latest budget presentation, the finance minister signaled an intention to increase public spending at a rate faster than the expected nominal economic growth. This shift from austerity to increased expenditure can be attributed to the upcoming national election scheduled for 2014.
