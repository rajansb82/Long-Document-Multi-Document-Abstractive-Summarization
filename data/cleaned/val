"Bengal bans gutka, pan masala for one year starting 7 November","The state government today announced a ban on the manufacturing and sale of gutkha and pan masala containing tobacco for a year. According to a notification issued by the state health and family welfare department, the ban will come into effect from 7 November 2021. The notification stated that the decision has been taken keeping in mind the health of the people. The commissioner of food safety is empowered under Section 30 of the food safety and standards act, 2006 to impose such a ban on the manufacture, storage, distribution or sale of any article of food in the entire state, the notification stated. “As per regulation 2.3.4 of the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions on Sales) Regulations, 2011 made by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, in the exercise of powers conferred by clause (i) of sub-section (2) of section 92 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (Central Act 34 of 2006) read with section 26 thereof, prohibits the sale of articles of food in which tobacco and/or nicotine are used as ingredients, as they may be injurious to health,” read the notification. Tobacco and nicotine are widely used as ingredients in gutkha and pan masala. In 2019 the state government had issued a notification stating that making, storing, and selling of all things in which nicotine is found would be legally punishable. The state governments usually earn a lot of tax revenue from the sale of these items. However, in the interest of public health, many states across the country have gradually taken steps to ban gutkha and other products with nicotine. The Mamata Banerjee government had decided to ban gutkha, betel spice and several other tobacco products for the first time in 2019. In 2013, the state government had banned khaini, gutkha and pan masala in West Bengal for one year.","The state government announced a one-year ban on the manufacturing and sale of gutkha and pan masala containing tobacco, effective from November 7, 2021. The decision, aimed at protecting public health, is enforced under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. This follows similar measures taken by other states to curb the use of tobacco products, which are harmful to health.",Health and Wellness,2021-10-27 00:00:00

Heroines are the new heroes,"Not only heroes, heroines too have been playing some powerful roles in films these days. Nayanthara essayed the role of an intelligent IPS trainee, who was instrumental in trapping the villain in Thani Oruvan. Another instance, it was Dhanshikaa, who played a courageous rape victim in Thiranthidu Seesae. After an impressive performance as Devasena in Baahubali, Anushka plays the role of a warrior princess in her next film, Rudhramadevi. Take Avanthika from Bahubali, the character played by Tamannaah is introduced as she waylays a bunch of ninja-esque soldiers without as much as breaking a sweat. She has sworn her life to free erstwhile queen Devasena, from the clutches of vicious king Bhallaladeva. But there are a few directors who are particular about their heroines role being important to the plot. Director Gautham Menon, known for his strong women characters that see an interesting graph all through a films story, says, I think the character sketches are generally a reflection of what one understands and perceives. Personally , I see women as strong and empowered people.","Recent films have featured powerful female characters.

"On campaign trail, Modi hits back at rivals over Pak aggression","Mumbai: Under fire, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched a counter offensive against Congress and NCP on ceasefire violations by Pakistan, saying such issues should not be dragged into political discourse as he hauled them over the coals over corruption in Maharashtra. NCP boss and former Defence Minister Sharad Pawar was the butt of Modi’s criticism as he continued to hit the campaign trail for Maharashtra Assembly poll with a vengeance despite being dubbed an “absentee” Prime Minister by Congress. “When you were the defence minister, there were problems with Pakistan and China on the border. Did you ever bother to go to the border then?” “There have been terror strikes in Maharashtra during your tenure… Mumbai, Malegaon, Pune. You could not even reach the terrorists, leave alone catching them. In the spirit of patriotism, we never politicised the issue,” he told an election rally at Baramati, Pawar’s pocket borough. Modi was responding to Pawar’s criticism for holding a string of election meetings despite the tension on the border following repeated ceasefire violations by Pakistan that have caused civilian casualties. “Today, when bullets are being fired on the border, it is the enemy that is screaming. Our jawans have responded to the aggression with courage,” he said, adding “the enemy has realised that times have changed and their old habits will not be tolerated.” Deprecating a political discourse over ceasefire violations, he said, “Such an issue should not be part of a political debate… Elections will come and go, governments will come and go, but please don’t demoralise those fighting on the border by debating these things for political gains.” Seeking to turn the tables on the Opposition over its criticism of the government for handling the situation on the border, Modi again raised the issue at a poll rally in Mumbai, saying, “I am astonished by their nonsensical statements and they want me to respond. “You tell me, should I respond. Should the PM respond to this. The jawan standing on the border is responding with his hand on the trigger. There will not come a time when the PM has to respond, this is the strength of my government,” he said. “Never be fooled by attempts to create confusion on this issue. Your trust is my strength,” the Prime Minister said amid chants of “Modi! Modi”. Pawar and his nephew Ajit, Maharashtra’s former Deputy Chief Minister, were in the line of Modi’s fire again when he raked up an embarrassing episode involving the latter that could prove damaging during the election. “Don’t you remember what he (Ajit Pawar) told you when you asked for water? It was only water you had asked for. It is unthinkable that such people become ministers, my head hangs in shame. “They have no right to ask for votes. It is a matter of your prestige now. Throw them out,” Modi said referring to Ajit Pawar’s unseemly comment about a fasting farmer demanding water in the drought-prone region. Ajit Pawar, while ridiculing a farmer fasting for water had said at Indapur a few months ago, “He has been fasting for the last 55 days. If there is no water in the dam, how can we release it? Should we urinate into it? If there is no water to drink, even urination is not possible.” Equating Pawar family’s grip over Baramati to slavery, Modi said, “The nation became independent but Baramati is still yoked to slavery. Be it for job or water for farms, people have to seek permission from the uncle-nephew duo. Farmers cannot even sell their sugarcane crop without their nod.” “Gandhiji shook the British empire with a handful of salt at Dandi. You don’t have to even use your fist to get freedom. What you need is a finger to press on BJP’s lotus symbol and freedom will be yours,” he said. Modi said NCP’s election symbol clock symbolised their misdeeds. “NCP’s clock (party symbol) is actually an eye opener. If you observe it closely you will find the clock is stuck at 10. It tells us that in 10 years corruption has grown 10 times during their rule. Such politicians have no place in Maharashtra politics,” he said. While Ajit Pawar is a sitting MLA from Baramati, Sharad Pawar won the seat five times in a row from 1991 to 2009 when he handed over the baton to his daughter Supriya Sule, who won the seat twice in 2009 and 2014. At his rally in Mumbai, his second in six days, Modi again targeted the Pawars, saying, “The musclemen politicians, uncle-nephew duo… all will be wiped out in the election.” “There is anger after oppression and today I see that anger on every face. Mahatma Gandhi gave the call for total freedom from this land. I ask you today for giving us total majority,” he said. Referring to his criticism for frequently invoking Maratha king Shivaji during his election speeches, Modi said, “In this election, parties are squabbling over Chhatrapati Shivaji. Shivaji belongs to everybody, to every generation. He has eternal greatness.” “I ask Sharad Rao (Pawar) if you have great love for Shivaji, why didn’t you build a magnificent memorial to him? Why you remember him only during elections? Today, people are crying for a memorial to Babasaheb Ambedkar. Cannot we do this for the man who gave us Constitution,” he asked. Modi has been criticised by former ally Shiv Sena for trying to appropriate its enduring icon despite not even once celebrating his birth anniversary. The Prime Minister said all previous equations based on caste and creed were on the death bed and soon there will be no place for vote bank politics","Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched a counter offensive against Congress and the National Congress Party (NCP) over ceasefire violations by Pakistan, arguing that such issues should not be dragged into political discourse.

Centre says rape cases must be probed within 2 months,"The Centre has issued a fresh advisory to states and UTs on mandatory action in cases of crimes against women, and said probe into rape cases must be completed within two months as per law, and that the dying declaration of a victim can’t be discarded merely because it has not been recorded by a magistrate. The detailed three-page advisory of the union home ministry came days after the alleged gangrape and murder of a woman in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh sparked nationwide outrage. The home ministry said there should be compulsory registration of an FIR in case of a cognizable offence under the CrPC, and any failure of the police to adhere to laid down rules does not augur well for the delivery of justice. The law also enables the police to register an FIR or a ‘zero FIR’, in case the crime is committed outside the jurisdiction of police station, in the event of receipt of information on commission of a cognizable offence, which includes cases of sexual assault on women, the ministry said. “However, even with stringent provisions in law and several capacity building measures undertaken, any failure of police to adhere to these mandatory requirements may not augur well for the delivery of criminal justice in the country, especially in the context of women safety,” it said. “Such lapses, if noticed, need to be investigated into and stringent action taken immediately against the concerned officers responsible for the same,” the advisory to states and UT administrations said. The home ministry told the states and the UT administrations that Section 173 of the CrPC provides for completion of police investigation in relation to rape in two months and Section 164-A of the CrPC provides that in rape or sexual assault investigation, the victim should be examined by a registered medical practitioner under consent within 24 hours from the time of receiving the information relating to the commission of such offence",The Centre has issued a fresh advisory requiring prompt action in cases of crimes against women.

"Transparency, Trust, and Security Needs for the Design of Digital News Authentication Tools","Americans' trust in news is declining, and authenticity and transparency challenges in digital publishing contexts pose unique challenges to the ability to effectively gratify their information-seeking needs via online media. Cryptographic technologies and web-based provenance indicators have the potential to enhance the trustworthiness and transparency of digital communication, but better understandings of news consumers practices and needs are required to develop practical tools. Through a representative online survey of 400 digital news consumers and 19 follow-up interviews, we investigate how users authenticate and assign trust to news content, and identify specific needs pertaining to news transparency and authentication that could be met by digital news authentication tools. While many users currently rely on political ideology to assess news trustworthiness, we find that users of all political orientations see value in independent provenance and authentication tools for digital news.","This study likely delves into the essential aspects of designing digital tools for authenticating news sources, with a focus on transparency, trustworthiness, and security. The research probably explores the key requirements and considerations needed to develop effective mechanisms for verifying the authenticity of digital news content. These considerations likely involve transparency in the authentication process, building trust among users, and ensuring robust security measures to prevent misinformation and disinformation. By addressing these needs, the research aims to contribute to the development of tools that can help users distinguish between reliable and unreliable news sources in the digital landscape.

The latest proposal by the central government on what constitutes ‘fake’ news articles is ill-conceived and unwarranted and amounts to infringing on free speech. The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) has released modifications to the draft Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, and sought public feedback. Essentially, it means that the government can direct social media companies to take down news articles that have been deemed “fake” by the Press Information Bureau (PIB), a nodal agency of the central government. Predictably, the move has triggered strong resistance from the opposition parties and the Editors Guild of India. According to the draft proposals, any piece of news that has been identified as “fake” by the fact-checking unit of the PIB will not be allowed on online intermediaries, including social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Such posts would have to be removed by online entities, without any recourse or avenue for redress. This is totally arbitrary and violative of the fundamental principles of freedom of expression. The determination of fake news cannot be in the sole hands of the government because it will result in the censorship of the press. The PIB is a government agency and how can it determine which is fake or real news? It is obvious that it will work for the benefit of the government. The move amounts to the government anointing itself judge, jury and executioner of online content regulation. Instead of imposing such unreasonable restrictions, the Centre must initiate meaningful consultations with media organisations and other stakeholders, on the regulatory framework for digital media, so as to not undermine press freedom.","The central government's proposal to amend IT Rules and empower the Press Information Bureau (PIB) to identify ""fake"" news articles for takedown from social media platforms has drawn strong criticism. The draft allows the government to unilaterally decide what constitutes fake news, raising concerns over press freedom and censorship. Critics argue that this move infringes on free speech and gives the government unchecked control over online content. The Editors Guild of India and opposition parties have voiced strong opposition, urging the government to consult media stakeholders instead of enforcing restrictive regulations.",Opinion and Editorial,2023-01-23 00:00:00
RBI may prolong the pause on Repo rate,"Alleyes are on Reserve Bank of India as its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kicked off its three-day bi-monthly meet on Wednesday. Its key decisions will be announced on Friday. It is the last meeting of the year and comes ahead of the Union Budget (likely a Vote on Account in view of General Elections in a few months) on February 1, 2024. The MPC not only studies economic scenario and fluctuations, but also fixes monetary policy to achieve price stability i.e., keeping inflation stable and well under target. Maintaining inflation low as well as stable helps people and businesses better plan their savings, spending and investments, a key to economic prosperity. The RBI has been striving to keep the inflation low and bring it down to 4% (with a tolerance band of +/- 2%) through monetary policy interventions, mainly through the Repo rate. It had to raise the Repo rate (at which the central bank of a country lends money to commercial banks) by 250 basis points – one basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point – between May 2022 and February 2023. If the Repo is increased, the cost of borrowing goes up for banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), squeezing their margins, and they in turn effect hike in loan rates to their customers. However, the fixed deposit rates rise or fall in tandem with the repo rate. Besides this key task of rate fix, the central bank remains watchful of risks such as global supply shocks and their implications for the price stability measures in the country, which are taken stock of at the MPC meetings. High inflation means reduction of purchasing power in the hands of consumers, affecting their cost of living and, hence, buying decisions. When RBI raises cost of borrowing, lending to businesses and cost of their debt, too, rise. They cut corners, put off recruitments, effect layoffs, causing a domino effect, raising further pressure on households, a situation of potential recession. Therefore, the RBI’s eagle watch on the state of inflation. With the inflation ruling above 6.5%, the RBI MPC during its last meeting in October kept repo rate unchanged at 6.5%, maintaining status quo. How have been the inflationary risks in the country? The headline and core inflation has been easing. The benchmark inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), fell from 7.4 per cent in July to 4.9% in October. Such low levels have not been witnessed since March 2020. While this may show inflation could not be much of a worry for the economy, just look at the food price volatility. Comprising nearly 39% in the CPI basket, it has been ruling quite high of late, above 6 per cent. As a result, CPI has been inching higher. Further, the effect of El Nino and winter crop uncertainties pose a threat to the current benign inflationary conditions. While the CPI core inflation, excluding food, was about 3.7% since October, the CPI including food was around 6.6 per cent. This is being cited by experts and analysts to predict that the RBI is unlikely to bring down the repo rate. Though a fall in private consumption is inducing arguments for a lower repo rate, and even despite a robust growth in economy, the RBI may not venture into reversing the 250 basis point in the repo rate. The consumer sentiment is not yet cautionary, it seems. It is expected to go in for prudential measures aimed at macroeconomic stability, on the lines of recent hike in risk weightage for retail lending and banks’ loans to NBFCs.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is preparing for its final meeting of the year, which will be announced on Friday. The MPC will focus on achieving price stability, keeping inflation low and well under target, which is crucial for economic prosperity. The RBI has been working to keep inflation low and bring it down to 4% through monetary policy interventions, mainly through the Repo rate. The central bank has raised the Repo rate by 250 basis points between May 2022 and February 2023, which increases the cost of borrowing for banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), squeezing their margins and affecting loan rates. However, fixed deposit rates also rise or fall in tandem with the repo rate. The RBI is also monitoring global supply shocks and their implications for price stability measures.

Allotment of 72 plots to MSME minister cancelled,"KANPUR The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday cancelled the allotment of 72 plots to MSME minister Rakesh Sachan in Fatehpur 11 years ago during the Samajwadi Party rule when he was SP MP from the district. A resolution to this effect was adopted and unanimously approved at the district Udyog Bandhu meeting here. Nine of the 10 members of Udyog Bandhu attended the special meeting. General manager (industries) Ajinesh Kumar Singh mooted the resolution for the cancellation of the allotments to Sachan, his NGOs ‘Abhinav Seva Sansthan’ and ‘Seema Shikshan Sansthan’ in 2012-2013. The plots would be allotted again to the eligible people and the department would ensure that the land is used for the purpose it has been sought for, said Singh. The allotments were found when the industries and MSME department looked for vacant land in industrial estates across Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Global Investors Summit. A body of entrepreneurs, Laghu Udyog Bharti, which supports small businesses, had on February 11 complained to the government about the allotment of plots to Sachan. Satyendra Singh, president of this body, said the cancellation was welcome and the land be given to the worthy entrepreneurs. “Industrialisation of Fatehpur, which is one of most backward districts, should be a priority,” he added. Sachan, on his part had, said the land was allotted to him and the NGOs for setting up educational institutions in line with the government policy. “The schools were not established as the area was not developed and industries were not coming. I have returned the plots formally to the industries and MSME department,” he said. But he did not reply as to why he and his NGOs did not deposit 10% of total cost as minimum allotment fee.","The Uttar Pradesh government has cancelled the allotment of 72 industrial plots given to MSME minister Rakesh Sachan and his NGOs in Fatehpur during the Samajwadi Party rule around 2012-2013.

The promises of 2010,"The year 2009 may not have been the best of times for Kollywood, but it wasn���������t bad either. And there are plenty of things to look forward to in 2010. A couple of big-budget superstar films and new multiplexes are on the anvil. The boom in production looks all set to continue and it seems like Tamil films will only get bigger. But for that to happen, small budget films should keep within their budget, and the first copy should be made under Rs 4 crore. The directors who are successful making small films should stick to their core strength instead of chasing superstars. Directors of substance like Mysskin, Cheran, Susindran, Pandiraj and Arivazhagan must not be lured by the call of big budget films. They should have confidence in their scripts and continue to try out innovative and new themes within the commercial format. Here���������s a look at what the year ahead has in store for Kollywood fans. The most eagerly-awaited movie of the year is Rajinikanth and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan���������s Shankar-directed Endhiran. The film is believed to be made on a budget of Rs 120 crore and is said to have high-tech special effects that have never before been seen in Indian movies. The film was originally slated for April 2010, but shooting is yet to be completed and the post-production work is also likely to take time. This means the movie might only see a Diwali release. Selvaraghavan���������s magnum opus Aayirathil Oruvan featuring Karthi, Reemma, Andrea and Parthepan is scheduled to release for Pongal. The film is said to be a first-of-its-kind in the action- adventure-fantasy genre and has been in the making for the last three years. Selva has used state-of-art special effects and graphics for this big budget entertainer which has been sold to distributors at a record price. Ajith, who did not have a release in 2009, is betting big on Asal, in which he plays a stylish international don with Sameera Reddy, Bhavana and a host of villains for company. The film, directed by the actor���������s favourite filmmaker Saran, is slated for release on February 5. Another film which is making waves even before release is Gautham Menon���������s Simbu-Trisha musical Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa which has music scored by AR Rahman. The film is likely to release for the Valentine���������s weekend. The big summer release of 2010 is going to be Suriya���������s Singam directed by Hari, where the actor once again dons the role of a fierce avenging cop, a la Dirty Harry in the company of Anushka. Then there���������s critically-acclaimed director Vetrimaran���������s Aadukalam set in the Madurai milieu with Dhanush in the lead. Another big summer release is going to be Mani Ratnam���������s Raavan which is being made in Tamil, Hindi and Telugu. The Tamil and Telugu versions have Vikram playing the lead opposite Aishwarya Rai and also stars actors like Prithviraj, Priyamani, Prabhu and Karthik. Says Vikram, ���������It is one of the best films I have ever done in my life. Mani sir has made it the movie to watch out for and, personally, it is going to be important for me as I���������m being launched in Hindi cinema with this film.","Despite a mixed 2009, Kollywood anticipates a promising 2010 with big-budget films and new multiplexes. To sustain growth, small-budget productions are advised to stay under Rs 4 crore and focus on originality over star power. Directors like Mysskin, Cheran, and Susindran are urged to maintain their unique styles. Highly anticipated releases include Rajinikanth's ""Endhiran,"" Selvaraghavan's ""Aayirathil Oruvan,"" Ajith's ""Asal,"" Gautham Menon's ""Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa,"" Suriya's ""Singam,"" Vetrimaran's ""Aadukalam,"" and Mani Ratnam's ""Raavan.""",Entertainment,2010-01-01 00:00:00
E-way bills hit record 90.9 mn in March on surge in biz activity,"New Delhi : Electronic permits raised by businesses for moving goods within and across states hit a record 90.9 million in March, indicating robust economic activity in the final month of the financial year, according to data available from GSTN, the company that processes GST returns. The surge in activity points to businesses pushing goods into the supply chain as they strive to meet annual targets, mirroring last year’s activity, which resulted in record GST receipts of ₹1.67 trillion in April. Taxes collected in the current month will correspond to sales achieved by businesses in March. GSTN data shows that 57.8 million e-way bills were generated in March for goods shipment within states and 33 million permits for inter-state shipments. This is an 11% improvement over the total e-way bills raised in February. Earlier this month, S&P Global reported that India’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index or PMI rose from 55.3 in February to 56.4 in March, signalling the sharpest improvement in operating conditions in 2023 so far. March data highlighted a further upturn in new business placed with Indian manufacturers. This expansion, the market intelligence provider said, was sharp and the quickest in three months. Surveyed businesses cited demand resilience and competitive pricing as growth drivers. “Since March signifies year-end closing for all businesses who are focused on achieving their sales targets for the fiscal year, the despatch volumes would be quite high, leading to potentially high GST collections,“ said M.S. Mani, partner at Deloitte India. Archit Gupta, founder and CEO of Clear, a business-to-business fintech software as a service (SaaS) company, said that the over 90 million e-way bills in March and the revenue collected in March of ₹1.6 trillion (relating to February sales), the second highest since April 2022 GST revenue receipts, indicated two things: “For one, businesses are pushing themselves to achieve year-end sales targets and fulfil orders, and this is apparent in the number of e-way bills issued. Secondly, there are stringent anti-evasion measures by the GST mobile squad that weed out defaulters and urge taxpayers and transporters to comply,” Gupta said. To be sure, e-way bill data only indicates permits generated for shipping consignments valued more than ₹50,000, and the cumulative value of all permits or the tax revenue due cannot be known from the number of permits raised. The e-way bill data will offer confidence to policymakers about the last quarter of FY23. Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations said on Tuesday said total vehicle sales grew by 14% annually in March, with double-digit growth in sales of passenger and commercial vehicles and in two and three-wheelers. In addition, tractor sales saw a 4% annual growth in March. Policymakers are banking on a normal monsoon, a lesser than previously expected slowdown in global economic growth and an early resolution of the conflict in Eastern Europe as potential upside to an expected 6.5% growth rate in FY24. However, ebbing pandemic-related pent-up demand and high inflation remain areas of concern. Two multilateral agencies, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, moderated India’s growth outlook for FY24 earlier this week. While the World Bank lowered its forecast to 6.3% from its December estimate of 6.6%, citing slower consumption growth and challenging external conditions, the ADB sharply cut its outlook to 6.4% in FY24, down from its December forecast of 7.2%, citing the ongoing global economic slowdown, tight monetary conditions, and elevated oil prices.","In March, electronic permits for goods movement within and across states hit a record high of 90.9 million, signaling robust economic activity at the end of the financial year, according to GSTN data. This surge mirrors last year's pattern, which led to record GST receipts in April. The increase in e-way bills suggests businesses striving to meet annual targets, with improved figures compared to February. The rise in permits aligns with a sharp improvement in India's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in March, reflecting increased new business orders and demand resilience. Analysts attribute the high e-way bill numbers to businesses aiming to meet year-end sales targets and anti-evasion measures by GST authorities. While e-way bill data doesn't directly reveal tax revenue, it offers policymakers confidence in FY23's final quarter performance. Despite optimism, concerns persist over pandemic-related demand fluctuations and high inflation. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank have moderated India's growth outlook for FY24 due to slower consumption growth, challenging external conditions, and the global economic slowdown.",Business and Finance,2023-04-07 00:00:00

Surreal flashes of reality,"The Spanish flu killed around a 100 million people worldwide. Yet its visible impact on popular culture has been minimal. Psychologist James Wertsch, while researching how a society forms a collective memory, had said that, “The virus is just not an ideal character for an ideal narrative.” He went on to boldly predict, in mid-2020 as COVID-19 raged, that “In a matter of a few years, we might forget this.”The changeless days of the lockdown fostered a kind of amnesia, resistant to the grip of memory. Basically, people forget. The brain forms event boundaries. Pandemic becomes endemic. We move on.Journalist Raj Kamal Jha’s novel The Patient in Bed Number 12, set during the second wave, marks the beginning of the post-pandemic era, at least in letters. Nothing marks the end of a phenomenon than stories being written about it. Turning the pages of Jha’s latest is like finding a long-forgotten stash of face masks and hand sanitizers; here, schools are still in “hybrid mode”, those with “comorbidities” are at risk, and there is talk about a time that will come “after the curve has flattened”.The story begins in the ICU ward of a corporate hospital. Jha evokes the lexical architecture of this anteroom to death, with its sepsis, saline drips, pleural effusions, and nasogastric tubing. The unnamed narrator, who is a professor of Sanskrit, is estranged from his only daughter, as she has married a Muslim man. At death’s doorstep, he now hopes for a reconciliation, and is desperately waiting for her.Dose of lifeThe head nurse, Sister Shiny, tells him that “you won’t last long if you just lie here sleeping, staring at the ceiling or the floor”. And the only way is that every day, “you need a moment of a life being lived to the full” which is “your daily pill”. This is the conceit of the novel, and so, in “the city beyond the bridge… maybe some will get to see an old man from the hospital flying above, looking for a story”.Despite the immobile narrator, we dip into other people’s lives through a series of interconnected chapters, whose connections are not apparent at first. The characters could be a security guard in the mall next door or a woman whose marriage is breaking down or an out-of-work photographer. There are also surreal flashes, for instance, the “raat ka karkhana” where child labourers toil to “fill glass jars with night which will be shipped across the world. The Prime Minister makes a cameo as “Our Great Doctor” who glides like a ghost every night through the ward, his beard is “a cloud leaving a trail of raindrops” on the floor to “rummage in their minds” and snip out thoughts that “pose a threat to the nation”.Jha stuffs the proceedings with all the horrors of this age; there are references to the Akhlaq case, to love jihad, mob lynchings, fake news on WhatsApp. Unfortunately, such a sprawling attempt to capture “Modi’s India”, while well-intentioned, starves the narrative of oxygen.

CM lashes out at Centre in House,"Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said that the Central Bureau Investigation (CBI) raid on his deputy Manish Sisodia has only helped strengthen the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) support base in Gujarat, a state where the ruling party in Delhi is campaigning aggressively ahead of the assembly elections this year.

Supreme Court grants bail to lifer Perarivalan in Rajiv killing case,"NEW DELHI: Taking note of the fact that he has already spent 32 years in jail and there has been inordinate delay in deciding his remission plea which is still pending, the Supreme Court on Wednesday granted bail to A G Perarivalan who is undergoing life imprisonment in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. While granting relief to Perarivalan, a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and B R Gavai also raised question on how can the governor refer his remission petition to the President despite the state cabinet recommendation to allow his plea.","The Supreme Court granted bail to A G Perarivalan, a convict in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, considering his 32 years served in jail and the delay in his remission plea.

Toyota reports dozens of complaints about Prius brakes,"The Japanese government said Wednesday it has received 14 complaints in Japan about brake problems with Toyota's popular Prius hybrid, the latest in a spate of quality troubles for the automaker as it grapples with massive recalls in the USThe Japanese company's sales are being battered in the U.S. after recalls of top-selling models to fix a gas pedal that can stick in the depressed position. The new Prius gas-electric hybrid, which went on sale last year, is not part of the recalls, which extend to Europe and China and cover nearly 4.5 million vehicles. The 14 complaints included an accident in July 2009, in which a Prius crashed head on into another car at an intersection. Transport ministry official Masaya Ota said two people were slightly injured in the accident. ""The complaints involve the new Toyota Prius model, and the vehicles were all made in Japan,"" Ota said. ""Prius drivers complained brakes were not so sharp."" The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received about 100 complaints involving the brakes of the Prius new model. Two involved crashes resulting in injuries. The ministry ordered Toyota Motor Corp., the world's No. 1 automaker, to investigate the complaints. The other 13 cases happened from December to January 2010. Ota said the ministry has yet to receive a formal report on the complaints from Toyota. Toyota spokeswoman Ririko Takeuchi said the company has received reports about the Prius complaints in North America and in Japan and was now looking into the matter. Toyota shares dropped 3.7 percent to 3,470 yen in the morning session Wednesday. The Japanese automaker is facing growing criticism that it has not done enough to ensure the safety of its vehicles. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood told The Associated Press Tuesday that federal officials had to alert Toyota to the seriousness of the safety issues that eventually led to the recalls. ""They should have taken it seriously from the very beginning when we first started discussing it with them,"" he said. ""Maybe they were a little safety deaf."" LaHood also said the U.S. government was considering civil penalties for Toyota for having dragged its feet on safety concerns. Toyota executive vice president Shinichi Sasaki acknowledged Tuesday in a Nagoya, Japan, news conference that Toyota had been looking into the gas pedal problems, and it took prodding from NHTSA officials for the company to decide on the U.S. recall. Toyota has long prided itself on sterling vehicle quality and assembly line methods that empowered workers to ensure faultless production. The latest recall, announced Jan. 21, over sticky gas pedals affects 2.3 million vehicles in the U.S. alone. Any serious problems emerging in the Prius, Toyota's flagship green car model, is certain to further tarnish its brand. The Prius, now in its third generation since its 1997 introduction, is the bestselling gas-electric hybrid in the world, racking up a cumulative 1.6 million units sold so far, according to Toyota. Hybrids, by going back and forth between a gasoline engine and electric motor, tend to offer better mileage in slow-speed and stop-and-go driving that's common in crowded cities.","The Japanese government has received 14 complaints in Japan about brake problems with Toyota's popular Prius hybrid car, the latest in a series of quality issues for the automaker. The complaints include an accident in July 2009 where a Prius crashed head-on into another car, slightly injuring two people. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has also received around 100 complaints about the brakes in the new Prius model, with two involving crashes resulting in injuries. The Japanese transport ministry has ordered Toyota to investigate the complaints. This comes as Toyota is facing growing criticism for not doing enough to ensure the safety of its vehicles, leading to massive recalls in the U.S. and other markets. Any serious problems with the Prius, Toyota's flagship hybrid model, could further tarnish the company's brand reputation.

It's both funny and sad,"Gopal Subramanium adds to AAP’s bizarre acts It comes as no surprise that the Centre has dismissed a plea by Mr Gopal Subramanium — who heads a panel constituted by the Delhi Government to probe the affairs of the Delhi & District Cricket Association — seeking the National Security Advisor's assistance in the investigation. The Union Home Ministry has reportedly termed the letter written by the former Solicitor General of India directly to the NSA as “silly” and “unprecedented”. No words could have better described the situation. Being one of the country's foremost legal minds, Mr Subramanium should have known better than to directly write to the National Security Advisor asking for his help, and that too on the unsubstantiated and pre-judged premise that the investigation could lead to issues of national security. The probe panel chief sought NSA Ajit Doval's assistance in the selection of “five of the best officers of the Intelligence Bureau, who should be of the level of Joint Director and below”. This is bizarre, to say the least. In the first place, the chosen channel of communication was wrong; the NSA does not directly correspond with the head of an inquiry commission a State Government sets (and here even the constitutional validity of the Aam Aadmi Party Government's power to do so without securing a green signal from the Centre is in doubt). The second point is that a State Government cannot seek the services of Central officers for its own inquiries. The third issue is that the Intelligence Bureau is not even an investigation agency and, therefore, seeking the agency's officers for a probe is ridiculous. But the bizarre and the ridiculous are not matters that bother either Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Government or, it seems now, even Mr Subramanium. It is unfortunate that the former Solicitor General is becoming an instrument in the hands of the Delhi regime in the latter's bid to sustain its vicious campaign against the Narendra Modi Government and Central agencies in particular. The Chief Minister has targeted everyone — from Prime Minister Modi to Union Minister for Home Affairs Rajnath Singh to lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung to Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi to the Central Bureau of Investigation, on a variety of issues ever since he assumed office. Of course, the Union Government's peremptory rejection of Mr Subramanium's letter will be exploited by Mr Kejriwal and his supporters as yet another instance of the Centre's refusal to ‘cooperate' with an elected State Government; a blow to the ‘federal spirit of the Constitution'; and ‘proof' of the complicity of persons in high places in the DDCA case that is sought to be probed. The Chief Minister will use the development to take his confrontation with the Centre to the next high level. Mr Kejriwal wants to keep the pot boiling. He is busy discovering new ways all his waking hours to engage the Union Government in a verbal battle; the little free time he gets is used for the pretence of governance. His failures on governance are too many to be listed here. It's no wonder that people have begun questioning whether they gave a massive mandate to the Aam Aadmi Party to conduct a running feud with the Centre or to administer Delhi. The Chief Minister must see reason before it’s too late.","The Centre dismissed Gopal Subramanium's plea for National Security Advisor's assistance in the DDCA probe, calling it unprecedented and inappropriate. Subramanium's request to involve Intelligence Bureau officers was criticized as impractical and unnecessary. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's government is accused of politicizing the issue to fuel its anti-Centre agenda, which includes constant confrontations and neglect of governance. The incident underscores the ongoing friction between the Delhi government and the Centre, raising questions about the AAP's priorities in governance versus political battles.",Politics,2015-12-31 00:00:00

"Exclusive Interview | Jim Sarbh on Rocket Boys being nominated for Emmy Awards, his journey in Bollywood, working as a lead, and more","Welcome to an exclusive interview with the charismatic and immensely talented Bollywood actor, Jim Sarbh. As he graces the global stage with his remarkable contributions to the world of entertainment, we delve into the excitement surrounding his recent Emmy Award nomination. From his entrancing performances to his captivating presence, Jim has carved a unique niche for himself in the film industry. Join us as we explore the intricacies of his journey, the challenges he’s overcome, and the artistry that has propelled him to international acclaim. In this candid conversation, Jim Sarbh opens up about his experiences, aspirations, and the profound impact of his craft on the cinematic landscape. Excerpts from the interview: Congratulations on the Emmy Nomination for Rocket Boys. I’m sure you are on cloud nine. But tell me something… Did the boy who started his career in 2014 ever think that he’ll reach here? I would say my career started well before Shuruaat Ka Interval. It started, officially, with a play in Atlanta called Ice Glen. I was just out of college, and it was my first properly paid acting gig. I don’t think the boy who was in Ice Glen could have imagined this exact career trajectory, but he did believe he would still be acting, 15 years later. He was full of the brash confidence of youth. He considers Neerja his first film (Shuruaat Ka Interval was a laugh). His film journey is only 7 years old, and he believes this is just the beginning. How did you find out about the nomination? What were you doing at that moment and what was the reaction? Let us live that moment… I had returned soaking wet from a very sweaty basketball game followed by a very rain-soaked bicycle ride back home. When I was in the shower, Abhay Pannu sent me a message, (he was on set so he couldn’t call). Nikkhil Advani called me twice, and he broke the news on the phone. My first reaction was confusion and awkwardness, to be honest, because I had entirely forgotten we had applied, and I had no idea they were being announced on the 26th. When I got the news, I was also (an hour) late to watch Dirty Harry with my Parsi neighbour Viraf Patel (how baug Parsi of me), so I rushed up apologetically and tried to ignore all the incoming calls. I was not successful. I will have to watch Dirty Harry again, or maybe Akela? Or maybe the best film about disillusionment with the system: Ardh Satya. Anyway, I digress. The initial awkwardness gave way to excitement very quickly. Working with the range of directors you have worked with, from Ram Madhvani to Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Zoya Akhtar, and Neeraj Ghaywan, does it take a while to adjust to different rhythms? I enjoy working with different directors and different rhythms because if you submit to their process, you can access different things within you, and learn new things about what works within their particular film universe. Every one of these extremely talented directors has their idea of ‘good acting,’ and although there is a lot of overlap between their definitions, there are also things particular to each style. For example, Mr. Bhansali loves an otherwise classic style of acting, stillness, and gravity and slightly pitched, but he particularly gets excited if you can achieve that and throw in a little mischief, a little glint in the eye, a little turning up of the mouth, a smile that just touches the eyes lightly, etc., etc. Ram Madhvani loves a character that seems to fit within the natural realistic range of acting but can use that style of acting to still be dramatic and surprising. Committing to their definition and style means you flow with their cinematic universe and also gives you an approach you can add to your backpack of tricks. Jim, how did it all start? When did you realise that you wanted to become an actor? Do you remember your first audition? I was obsessed with television; I could watch anything. I suppose it has all flowed from there. There was no eureka moment, it’s just that nothing else quite caught my attention in the same way. Stories, telling stories, being a part of telling stories, getting to live a hundred lives in one, observing like a sponge, capturing attention, being a vessel for something larger than yourself… I think my first audition was for a Hero Cycles ad. I got the part. “Why must I always win? Hero Cycles Y Generation Bikes.” Something like that. Good to remember ad taglines have always been silly. Why must I always win? God’s sake. You’ve played some real characters and essayed real-life stories like Padmaavat, Sanju, Neerja, and Rocket Boys. Tell us something about that. Truth is stranger than fiction, I suppose. There is a treasure trove of fascinating Indian stories out there. Real stories we can all take inspiration from. I am glad filmmakers are mining these depths, and allowing these stories to spread further and wider through their craft.","Jim Sarbh reflects on his Emmy nomination, crediting his journey from college plays to the global stage. His reaction to the news was a blend of confusion and excitement while watching ""Dirty Harry."" Adapting to different directors' styles enriches his acting, offering diverse experiences, methods, and cinematic universes. His passion for storytelling sparked his acting pursuit, from a Hero Cycles ad to essaying real-life roles in films like ""Padmaavat"" and ""Neerja.""",Entertainment,2023-11-19 00:00:00
Morgan Stanley remains 'overweight' on Infosys,"""Increased stock price volatility has made investing in Infosys riskier, said Morgan Stanley in its report on Monday. However, the leading foreign brokerage maintained its ‘Overweight’ rating on India’s second biggest software exporter with a target price of Rs 2,890. Lack of hiring, cost outlook have increased uncertainty on FY14e earnings, but this can be addressed by stronger execution and tighter cost control. Infosys stock is now trading at 12x FY14e EPS, which is towards the lower end of its historical trading range. “We believe that regardless of the revenue growth outlook in FY14e, normalisation of the cost structure and stronger management execution will be key for the stock to deliver sustainable returns,” said Morgan Stanley. Over the next three months, the stock could continue to languish. It is tempting to move to the sidelines when the stock gets so volatile. Management’s reluctance to address cost structure issues for FY14e and outline corrective measures have increased the volatility. Over the last 10 years’ trading history, such volatile moves in the stock have bottomed around trough valuations of ~12x 1- yr forward EPS.""","Morgan Stanley has maintained an 'Overweight' rating on Infosys, despite increased stock price volatility, stating that the lack of hiring and cost outlook has raised uncertainty for FY14e earnings.

Gorakhpur witnessing confluence of development and employment: CM,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath remarked that Gorakhpur, which instilled fear in people and lacked basic facilities just 15-20 years ago, is now emerging as a vibrant hub of development, employment and modern tourism. Speaking at the jetty of Ramgarh Taal following the inauguration of the floating restaurant ‘Float’ on Thursday, Yogi also presented allotment certificates to seven recipients of the Greenwood Apartment residential project of the Gorakhpur Development Authority (GDA). Reflecting on the past, the chief minister noted that Gorakhpur was once synonymous with fear and stagnation. “Seven years ago, the city was distant from any semblance of development, and the area around Ramgarh Taal, where today’s event took place, was infamous for filth and crime. Security had to be tightened for guests and officials, and the city faced severe traffic congestion,” he remarked. Discussing the transformative changes over the past seven years, Yogi said, “Gorakhpur now boasts four- and six-lane roads, a bustling airport, improved railway connectivity, a revitalised fertiliser factory, and a BRD Medical College that has become a premier medical institution, with AIIMS also now operational.” The chief minister noted that Ramgarh Taal, once nearly desolate, has now transformed into a vibrant attraction. This expansive natural lake, covering 1,800 acres, is now drawing tourists with its renewed charm. New hotels are opening, and a cruise service has already been launched. With the inauguration of a floating restaurant, Gorakhpur now offers a unique opportunity to enjoy refreshments and dining by the lakeside, he added. The chief minister emphasised that this modern development is not only enhancing the area’s appeal but also creating new employment opportunities. The chief minister announced that visitors to Gorakhpur will now enjoy five-star facilities. He highlighted the construction of a ring road around Ramgarh Taal that will transform the area into a full-day destination for families, guests and tourists. The experience will include exploring the lake’s beauty, enjoying the cruise and floating restaurant, and visiting the zoo to connect with nature, he added.. The chief minister praised the city’s nighttime allure, enhanced by excellent lighting, and expressed confidence that the floating restaurant will offer top-notch amenities to both locals and international tourists. He also mentioned upcoming developments, including a new chain of hotels and a convention centre, thanks to Gorakhpur’s improved connectivity. In his address to the allottees of Greenwood Apartment, Chief Minister Yogi urged the GDA officials to expedite the construction, aiming to complete it six months ahead of schedule while ensuring high quality. Although the GDA has set a target for July 2027, the chief minister emphasised the goal of finishing the project before Makar Sankranti in 2027. This will allow the allottees to celebrate the festival in their new homes and receive Makar Sankranti prasad there, Yogi pointed out. He also highlighted that Greenwood Apartment is being developed in a favorable environment and assured that the value of the flats will appreciate significantly in the coming years. On this occasion, Member of Parliament Ravi Kishan Shukla remarked that the transformation of Gorakhpur under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s leadership is evident to all. He noted that the city’s remarkable development over the past seven years stands in stark contrast to its previous state. Dr Manglesh Shrivastava, MLA Vipin Singh, Rajesh Tripathi, Mahendrapal Singh, Dr Vimlesh Paswan, Pradeep Shukla, GDA Board member Durgesh Bajaj, Pawan Tripathi, Radheshyam Shrivastava, Bharatiya Janata Party’s city president Rajesh Gupta and others were present at the function. GDA Vice-Chairman Anand Vardhan gave detailed information about the floating restaurant and Greenwood Apartment project. Meanwhile, after inaugurating the floating restaurant by pressing a button on the jetty at Ramgarh Taal, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath proceeded to the venue, where he cut the ribbon at the entrance and congratulated the staff on the successful launch. He then toured all the floors of the floating restaurant, reviewing the facilities and expressing his satisfaction with the arrangements. Managing director of the floating restaurant, Alok Agarwal, briefed the chief minister on the amenities available. During the visit, the chief minister also enjoyed some light refreshments at the restaurant. The floating restaurant at Ramgarh Taal offers five-star amenities, and according to the GDA, it is the first of its kind in North India. Spanning a total area of 9,600 square feet across three floors, the restaurant can accommodate 100 to 150 guests at a time.","Gorakhpur, once a hub of fear and stagnation, is now a hub of development, employment, and modern tourism.

G7 Summit commits toIndia-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor,"THE Group of Seven industrialised nations have committed to promoting concrete infrastructure initiatives such as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) in the G7 Summit Communique issued at the end of the threeday G7 Summit, attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Communique was issued on Friday evening after the customary “family photo” at the luxury resort of Borgo Egnazia, where the G7 also reiterated a commitment to a “free and open Indo-Pacific” based on the rule of law. Prime Minister Modi attended the G7 Summit at the invitation of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the host. “We will further promote concrete G7 PGII (Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment) initiatives, flagship projects, and complementary initiatives to develop transformative economic corridors for quality infrastructure and investment, such as the deepening of our coordination and financing for the Lobito Corridor, the Luzon Corridor, the Middle Corridor, and the India-Middle EastEurope Economic Corridor, also building on the EU Global Gateway, the Great Green Wall Initiative, and the Mattei Plan for Africa launched by Italy,” reads the communique. Billed as a path-breaking initiative, the IME Cenvisages a vast road, railroad and shipping network among Saudi Arabia, India, the United States and Europe to ensure integration among Asia, the Middle East and the West. The IMEC is also seen as an initiative by like-minded nations to gain strategic influence in the face of China’s Belt and Road Initiative(BRI) which has faced increasing criticism over lack of transparency and disregard for sovereignty of the nations. The BRI is a mega connectivity project that connects China with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Russia and Europe. The IMEC initiative was firmed up on the sidelines of the G20 Summit hosted by India in Delhi last year. About the Outreach session on Friday on the topic of Artificial Intelligence, Energy, Africa and the Mediterranean addressed by Modi, the Communique reads: “In a spirit of shared responsibility, we warmly welcome the participation of the Leaders of Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, India, Jordan, Kenya, Mauritania, Tunisia, Turkiye, and the United Arab Emirates. “We will step up our efforts to enhance interoperability amongst our AI governance approaches to promote greater certainty, transparency and accountability while recognizing that approaches and policy instruments may vary across G7 members. We will take a risk-based approach in these efforts as we seek to foster innovation and strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth.” Among the other priorities of the summit’s agenda, the communique registers “unwavering support” for Ukraine in its ongoing conflict with Russia. It notes: “With a view to supporting Ukraine’s current and future needs in the face of a prolonged defence against Russia, the G7 will launch Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) Loans for Ukraine, in order to make available approximatelyUSD50billioninadditional funding to Ukraine by the end of the year. “Therefore, without prejudice to possible other contributions and standing together, the G7 intends to provide financing that will be serviced and repaid by future flows of extraordinary revenues stemming from the immobilisation of Russian sovereign assets held in the European Union and other relevant jurisdictions. To enable this, we will work to obtain approval in these jurisdictions to use future flows of these extraordinary revenues to service and repay the loans.” Pope Francis became the first pontiff to join the participants of the G7 hosted by Italy–US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel.

BRO to upgrade 20km crack-affected stretch,"The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) will strengthen and upgrade the crack-affected 20 km stretch of Badrinath highway passing through Joshimath town in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, a senior official familiar with the matter said on Thursday. “It will be done in two phases. The work on Helang to Joshimath (12 km) is already going on, the work from Joshimath to Marwari (8 km) will be taken up soon,” added the official. Over 860 houses scattered around 4,500 buildings in Joshimath — known as the gateway to Badrinath and Hemkund Sahib pilgrimage sites — had developed cracks earlier this year in January. At least 181 buildings in the town were placed in the “unsafe zone”, and over 290 families were moved out to safer areas. Local residents had earlier reported cracks on Badrinath highway near Joshimath-Marwari stretch and a 10-foot-deep pit developing near a railway guest house. “The strengthening and upgrade work will include widening in certain patches, construction of side structures like walls, surface, and drainage,” Colonel Ankur Mahajan, BRO commander said. “We are aiming to complete the work from Helang to Joshimath this season (by the time the yatra starts next year). But as far as Joshimath to Marwari is concerned since we will take up the work soon ... .we will try to complete a part of it by the beginning of yatra season next year. However, the whole stretch won’t be completed due to our limitations ... .and working on that stretch is not possible during the yatra since it is a narrow stretch. Working during the yatra could lead to chaos,” he said. The BRO official further said they were also carrying out the construction of the five-km Helang-Marwari bypass. The construction of the bypass — which was halted on January 5 this year after the cracks developed in houses in Joshimath and residents’ agitation under the banner of Joshimath Bachao Sangharsh Samiti — restarted in June after the state government gave permission to the BRO. The work is expected to be completed in over two years. Under the Centre’s 12,000 crore ambitious Char Dham project, Helang-Marwari bypass, which is being constructed around 13 km from Joshimath at its foothill, aims to shorten the distance to Badrinath by 30 km. The Supreme Court, in 2019, ordered the setting up of a high powered committee to take a view on whether the Centre’s project needs to be “revised” to minimise its ecological damage. It also appointed noted environmentalist Ravi Chopra as the chairperson of the panel. On December 14, 2021 the Supreme Court permitted the Union government to construct all-weather roads with 10m width as part of its Char Dham project in Uttarakhand, underlining that “the recent past has thrown up serious challenges to national security”, and that wide strategic feeder roads to Indo-China border areas were required for the infrastructural needs of the armed forces. In February 2022, Chopra resigned from the post of chairperson, expressing disappointment over permission over the “brazen widening of roads” under the Char Dham project in the ecologically fragile Himalayas.","The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) plans to strengthen and upgrade a 20 km stretch of the Badrinath highway passing through Joshimath town in Uttarakhand. The project will be carried out in two phases, with work already underway from Helang to Joshimath. The initiative aims to address cracks in buildings and infrastructure caused by geological factors. Additionally, the construction of a bypass to shorten the distance to Badrinath is progressing after facing delays due to environmental concerns and local opposition.",National News,2023-12-08 00:00:00
Joe Biden goes on offense in Georgia while Donald Trump targets Midwest,"One week until Election Day, Joe Biden is going on offense, heading Tuesday to Georgia — which hasn't backed a Democrat for president since 1992 — and pushing into other territory where President Donald Trump was once expected to easily repeat his wins from four years ago. The Democratic presidential nominee planned to travel to Iowa, which Trump took by 10 points in 2016, later in the week. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, is heading to Arizona and Texas, where Republicans haven't lost any statewide office since 1994 — the nation's longest political winning streak. The aggressive schedule is a sign of confidence by the Biden team, which is trying to stretch the electoral map and open up more paths to 270 electoral college votes. But after Democrats flirted with GOP territory in 2016, only to lose those states as well as their traditional Midwestern strongholds, Biden's campaign is mindful of overreaching. The former vice president will also visit in the coming days Wisconsin, Michigan, and Florida. Georgia, where Biden will make two stops on Tuesday, has increasingly become a draw for Democrats in recent years, as turnout increases among Black voters and the Atlanta suburbs tilt away from the GOP. “If this was the Georgia of 2008, 2012 I think there's no way we would have seen a Biden come this late,” said Nsé Ufot, chief executive officer of the New Georgia Project, which aims to increase voter registration, especially among young people and minorities. “It's a loud signal and acknowledgement of Georgia as a battleground state.” Trump is staying focused on the so-called “blue wall” states that he flipped in 2016: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where he'll return on Tuesday to hit West Salem just three days after holding a Janesville rally. While Biden rarely travels to more than one state per day, the president has maintained a whirlwind schedule, crisscrossing the country and making the argument that he built a booming economy before the coronavirus pandemic upended it. His latest swing could be a victory lap after the Senate on Monday approved the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett and gave conservatives a commanding, 6-3 advantage on the Supreme Court. Trump has sought to use the vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last month to animate conservative evangelical and Catholic voters to his candidacy, but the high court fight has been overshadowed by concerns over the coronavirus with cases surging. Biden, meanwhile, is hoping to lift Democrats running for Senate in Georgia and Iowa with this travel plans. He planned to unveil his closing message during a Tuesday speech in Warm Springs, Georgia, where natural hot springs offered President Franklin Delano Roosevelt comfort as he battled polio and governed a nation weathering the Great Depression and World War II. The former vice president's campaign says his appearance will bookend his visit earlier this month to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, when Biden used the site of the bloody Civil War battle to issue a call for bipartisanship and putting country ahead of party. On Tuesday, he will try to evoke Roosevelt's New Deal sensitivities while promising to restore the nation's character. “This is our opportunity to leave the dark, angry politics of the past four years behind us,” Biden declares in a 60-second closing ad airing on national cable channels and 16 states his campaign considers battlegrounds. Both campaigns focused Monday on Pennsylvania, with Trump drawing thousands of largely mask-less supporters to rallies while Biden popped just over the border from his home in Delaware to greet a small group of supporters outside a campaign field office in Chester. Biden declared, “Bottom line is Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this pandemic.” Trump countered that his Democratic challenger would impose unnecessary shutdowns. “It's a choice between a Trump boom or a Biden lockdown,” the president said at a rally in Allentown. With more than a third of the expected ballots in the election already cast, it could become increasingly challenging for Trump and Biden to reshape the race. Biden is leading in most national polls and has an advantage, though narrower, in many key battlegrounds. The campaign's final week is colliding with deepening concerns about the COVID crisis. Trump is anxious for voters to focus on other issues such as the economy. Biden, meanwhile, has repeatedly hit Trump on the virus while presenting himself as a safer, more stable alternative. Several close aides to Vice President Mike Pence tested positive for the virus last weekend, including his chief of staff, Marc Short. Pence, though, has maintained a packed travel schedule. On Tuesday he'll be in South Carolina, a potential boost for Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is in a potentially tight reelection race. Biden has accused Trump of “waving the white flag” in his response to the virus, while Trump fired back Monday that the former vice president “waved a white flag on life.” Anticipating a razor-thin Electoral College margin, Trump has an aggressive schedule including a visit to Omaha, Nebraska, on Tuesday after a Sunday visit to Maine, aiming to lock up one electoral vote in each of the states that award them by congressional district. The president is scheduled hold a dizzying 11 rallies in the final 48 hours before polls close.","As the U.S. presidential election enters its final week, Joe Biden is expanding his campaign efforts into traditionally Republican-leaning states, such as Georgia and Iowa. The Democratic nominee is aiming to broaden the electoral map, and the campaign's confidence is reflected in Biden's travel schedule. In addition to Georgia and Iowa, Biden plans to visit Wisconsin, Michigan, and Florida. His running mate, Kamala Harris, is heading to Arizona and Texas. The campaign's strategy is to stretch the map and create multiple paths to reach the required 270 electoral college votes.",International News,2020-10-27 00:00:00

Wang's journey from Beijing to Canada sets him to become 3rd Chinese-born player picked in NHL draft,"Wang's journey from Beijing to Canada sets him to become 3rd Chinese-born player picked in NHL draft Invited to watch his first hockey practice at an ice rink in Beijing, Haoxi Wang was no different than any impressionable, wide-eyed 4-year-old being fascinated by the equipment the players wore. They resembled superheroes with sticks, uniforms and bulging pads, their faces hidden behind helmeted cages. This was before the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, when hockey was a niche sport in China and the NHL a mere pipe dream. Ex Gujarat CM passes away in the Ahmedabad plane crash. Read more details. “It was definitely the gear,” the 6-foot-5, 215-pound — and still growing — defenseman who goes by Simon recalled at the NHL pre-draft scouting combine in Buffalo earlier this month. “Something just clicked inside of me, and I just fell in love with the game,” Wang added. “Right away, I told my mom I need to get out there as soon as possible. And I probably went on the ice the next day or so.” This marked the start of a journey that saw a 12-year-old Wang move to Toronto and work his way up the junior ranks to play for the OHL Oshawa Generals. At 17, he is considered a candidate to be an early to mid-round pick in the NHL draft in Los Angeles this weekend. Based on Wang’s size and skating ability, there’s likely to be even more pinch-me moments ahead for someone in position to become just the third Chinese-born player — and potentially highest — selected in the NHL draft. Andong Song, chosen 172nd overall by the New York Islanders in 2015, was the first Chinese-born player drafted. Song never played professionally following two seasons with the USHL's Madison Capitols. Then there’s Kevin He, also from Beijing, who is on path to playing in the NHL. Drafted 109th by Winnipeg last year, He signed a three-year entry level contract with the Jets in December. Kevin He had the advantage of playing organized hockey at 6 when his family moved to Montreal. By comparison, Wang’s true introduction to the sport competitively came with his arrival in Toronto at the urging of a friend who made the move earlier to pursue hockey. It was a culture shock for Wang, who left his family behind and couldn't speak English. “I think courage would be the word, I would describe it,” Oshawa general manager Roger Hunt said. “The only language he knew was hockey. And he wanted to play. And he had the vision at that age to say, ‘Hey, if I want to do this, I better go there.’” Wang proved to be a quick study. Though raw, his ability almost immediately caught everyone’s attention. The only question for Hunt in selecting Wang in the fifth round of the 2023 OHL 16-year-old draft was his eligibility in having already committed to Boston University. The NCAA previously barred CHL players from competing at the college ranks before eliminating its rule in November. Wang made his debut with Oshawa in December. Though he finished with a modest five assists in 53 games on a team that lost to London in the OHL finals, Wang did not look out of place. “I don’t think anybody would have went into that arena and said, ‘Hey, this kid’s only played hockey five years,’” Hunt said. “He’s got such good feet, he skates so well, his edges, everything.” Next year, Hunt projects Wang to take on a larger role as Oshawa's top defenseman. Wang is ahead of schedule, in part due to the NCAA rule change. The initial plan last season, his agent John Walters said, was to have Wang stay in the OJHL, where he was already showing signs of dominating with four goals and 22 points in 38 games. Walters said it was at Wang’s urging to make the jump to OHL to spur his development against better competition. “I had a couple of NHL teams saying, ‘You should have left him in junior, because there would have been that wonderment about him.’ And I said, ‘But that wouldn’t have made him better,'” Walters said. “Simon doesn’t care whether he goes in the first, second or third round. He wants to get better. He needed to go challenge himself.” It was Walters who took Wang under his wing early after his arrival in Canada, with Walters’ father chauffeuring the player to practices and games. Another benefit was Wang’s mother, Willa, who was so inspired by her son’s passion for hockey, she became an ice-rink developer in China and she eventually purchased the Ontario Junior Hockey League team where her son played. The plan for Wang now is to compete in the OHL next season before making the jump to Boston University, where his older brother completed his post-graduate studies. “When I was 12, I had a very naive belief in me that I’m going to make it,” he said. “But I’m here right now and not taking any moment for granted. I’m still learning, and I might be still behind a lot of guys, but my potential and what I can become as a player, that’s what’s really exciting about me.”","**Haoxi “Simon” Wang**, a 17-year-old defenseman from Beijing, is poised to become just the third Chinese-born player drafted into the NHL. Standing at 6-foot-5, Wang moved to Toronto at age 12 to chase his hockey dream. After a strong OHL debut with Oshawa, he's seen as a promising mid-round NHL draft pick.",Sports,2025-06-24 00:00:00

Deep brain surgery helps 36-year-old woman move again,"After being in a vegetative state for more than a year-and-a-half, 36-year-old Bhavesha Gosrani has finally started moving her body again. Gosrani, who underwent Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery on April 3 in Jaslok Hospital, had given birth to twins in June 2016 through a c-section during which she suffered a hypoxic brain injury in the operation theatre. Due to lack of equipment in the maternity home, she was immediately shifted to a Mulund-based private hospital the next day. Gosrani was on a ventilator for 20 days and then was gradually weaned off. She was later shifted to her home but was in a vegetative state. Nikhil Gosrani, her husband, said, “She suffered from cardiorespiratory arrest on the table during the delivery of our children. Since then she never came back to normal life. For the past one-and-a-half years, Gosrani has been on medicines but in a vegetative state. We could see that she was getting emotional through her eyes. We never wanted to give up hope on her.” After waiting for her condition to improve naturally for a few months, she was taken to Jaslok Hospital to explore further possible medical treatment. Dr Paresh Doshi, Director of Department of Neurosurgery at Jaslok Hospital said, “After a few months of wait, there were no signs of improvement due to which we decided to perform the DBS surgery as she cleared all the selection criteria for the surgery. She showed signs of arousal during the surgery. After the surgery, she has been showing some movement. She will take at least three to four months to recover well.” Meanwhile, Dr Adil Chagla, Neurosurgeon at KEM Hospital, said, “I would not recommend DBS surgery. There will be a lot of challenges since we will be stimulating the brain which can also cause a side effect. A long-term rehabilitation could also have been a possible way to help the patient.”","Bhavesha Gosrani, who had been in a vegetative state for over a year-and-a-half due to a hypoxic brain injury during childbirth in June 2016, has shown signs of improvement after undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery at Jaslok Hospital.

Doctors expect her recovery to take several months. Meanwhile, other medical experts caution about the potential risks and challenges associated with DBS surgery.",Health and Wellness,2018-04-07 00:00:00
A few undesirable habits of patients,"Often many persons ask for a medicine for a symptom without caring for the underlying disease. They continue to use the same for quite some time till the disease advances, such as in generalised weakness, cough, recurrent fevers, hoarse voice, headache, difficulty in swallowing, swelling feet, giddiness, muscular and joint pains, low vision, etc. This symptomatic casual approach to a serious underlying disease can put you in great trouble later on while to nip the same in the very beginning is a wise approach. Instructions and preventive measures along with the needed medicine, explained by the doctor, are commonly ignored by many. Steam inhalation in allergic bronchitis, proper rest and good diet in viral infections, vocal rest in voice changes, low salt intake in blood pressure and washing of hands properly before meals can keep local infections at bay. If a child is suffering from diarrhoea, etc, parents are advised not to give milk and sweets for a few days, but the mother does not feel satisfied till she feeds the child with sweetened milk though along with medicines — thus not giving the desirable results. With due precautions while working on the computer, eye stains, headache and cervical pain can well be avoided. Proper follow-up is a casualty among our patients. Once symptoms are relieved, medicines are stopped. In many such cases, diseases get suppressed but resurface after sometime. So, taking a proper dose of medicines and for the recommended period, as in the case of antibiotics, is of great importance. Many patients, especially in the rural areas, do not come forward to tell the complaints they are suffering from due to the fear that they may be having some serious disease. In the case of sexually transmitted diseases, patients are too ashamed or embarrassed to seek medical attention because of cultural taboos. Delay in handling such cases results in harmful effects. Patients often want quick relief. They frequently change the doctor, even the system of medicine. Chronic diseases such as diabetes, BP and heart problems take a long time to tame with regular and prolonged treatment. Irregular treatment for such diseases is harmful. Self-medication must be avoided. Often patients accept the substitutes of the medicines on the written prescription that may be cheap, but sometimes these may be substandard or even fake. It is better to have the same brand even if you have to go from one chemist shop to another.","Ignoring underlying diseases and relying solely on symptomatic treatment can lead to worsening health conditions. Patients often neglect preventive measures and proper follow-up, opting for quick relief and changing doctors frequently. Self-medication and accepting cheap substitutes can be harmful. Proper adherence to treatment and medical advice is crucial for maintaining health.",Health and Wellness,2011-07-13 00:00:00

Pune: SPPU ties up with mountaineering schools,"In a bid to promote love for mountaineering amongst its students and encourage them to take up the adventure sport on a professional level, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) is tying up with professional mountaineering institutes operating in the Himalayan region to train its students. Dr Sanjaykumar Dalvi, director of SPPU’s Board of Students Welfare, which is carrying out the project, said a sum of Rs 5 lakh has been kept aside to sponsor 20 students in the first year of this project. “At the university or district level, our students have carried out many expeditions in the Sahyadri ranges but the Vice-Chancellor was of the opinion that if students want to take up mountaineering as a sport, then they should have some experience of mountaineering in the icy Himalayan regions, where the difficult peaks lie. Mountaineering is not just a sport but teaches one to push their limits, plan in detail, develop team spirit and acquire other qualities. For many students who might have interest, the opportunities or financial means may not be available. Also, if you want to do an expedition, you cannot just go for it directly; one has to clear the basic training levels. Hence we have decided to start mountaineering camps in the Himalayan ranges with the help of experts who will train our students right from the basic level. Also we plan to train the students in skiing,” said Dalvi.While nominations for the camps would be open to all, Dalvi said, selection would depend on the student’s physical fitness, interest in mountaineering and past experience. A few institutes recognised by the varsity are Manali’s Atal Behari Vajpayee Institute of Mountaineering and Allied Sports besides Himalayan Mountaineering Institute in Darjeeling. “Students will undergo an approximate 20 days training at the end of which they will get a certificate and those who are able to clear the first level, we will encourage to go to the next leve,” said Dalvi. “Also, next year we plan to add other adventure sports too,” added Dalvi.","Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) is collaborating with professional mountaineering institutes in the Himalayan region to instill a passion for mountaineering among its students.

Instead Tata Teleservices pre-paid CDMA subscribers will be charged Re 1 for all local calls and Rs 3 for long distance calls,regardless of the duration. Tata Indicom and Teleservices subscribers would be able to avail of the plan by paying a daily fee of Re 1 or Rs 30 monthly and call rates would also apply on mobile to landline and to calls made to other networks. Story continues below this ad The plan also offers subsidised rate for SMSes or short message service at Re 0.50,for both local and national SMS. “Pay-per-call will change the pricing paradigm in the telecom space and endless talks does not mean the caller will misuse the facility as there will be monitoring of the calling pattern of subscribes once any abuse of the scheme is noticed. Usually a caller talks for 405 minutes on a local call and three minutes on STD” ,said Tata Teleservices managing director Anil Sardana. Vineet Bhatia ,the company’s chief operating officer for Delhi and head of the northern region said ,”The service gives consumers freedom to talk to their hearts’ content without any of the hassles they face on the charging front.” Story continues below this ad The service is available on all new Tata Indicom connections for Rs 99 with a validity of 10 years ,and on one-time recharge of Rs 96 for existing customers. The company expects volumes to make up for the loss of average revenue per user in this plan. TTSL’s CDMA service is pan-India and has a subscriber base of under 40 million.","Tata Teleservices launched a revolutionary ‘Pay-Per-Call’ plan for its CDMA users, offering unlimited local calls for Re 1 and STD calls for Rs 3, regardless of duration. Available for a daily fee of Re 1 or Rs 30 monthly, it also includes SMS at Re 0.50. The plan, aimed at increasing user freedom and call volume, is expected to compensate for lower revenue per user through higher usage.",Business and Finance,2009-09-01 00:00:00
Microbubble tech to help revive Lucknow lakes,"To revive city lakes, the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) has introduced microbubble technology that would help in increasing the oxygen level of the decaying waterbodies. On Wednesday, the technology was put to use in Jamuna lake of Malviya nagar near Aishbagh area. The lake is at the verge of extinction due to dumping of garbage and encroachment. Assistant engineer KP Gupta said: ""Earlier in the month, vice-chairperson Indramani Tripathi had inspected the lake and instructed to restore it. Following which, water hyacinth and bushes growing in the lake were cleared. Further we have deployed two microbubble aeration boats that would clear the lake and oxygenate it. This will help in restoring the eco system of the lake.""","Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) has implemented microbubble technology to rejuvenate city lakes, starting with Jamuna Lake in Malviya Nagar. The lake, threatened by garbage dumping and encroachment, is undergoing restoration efforts. Water hyacinth and vegetation have been cleared, and two microbubble aeration boats deployed to oxygenate the water and improve the ecosystem.

PMO steps in after BSNL puts bid on hold,"NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) is all set to intervene in BSNL’s tender fiasco as the state-owned telco has now decided to put its 93 million lines GSM contract, the world’s largest equipment deal, ‘on hold,’ an executive with direct knowledge of the development told ET. The PMO has called for a meeting on January 6 to discuss BSNL’s performance as the telco has been losing revenues and market share — the delay in awarding contracts in the 93 million lines tender will be a primary issue on the agenda, this executive explained. According to government officials aware of the development, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will meet communications minister A Raja, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, department of telecom secretary PJ Thomas, top executives from BSNL including its CMD Kuldeep Goyal, executives from the Planning Commission and Knowledge Commission chairman Sam Pitroda (who is also a special advisor to the DoT) during the January 6 meeting to discuss the plight of BSNL. PlayUnmute Fullscreen BSNL has been making huge operating losses in the past two years, only managing to stay in the black because of interest income from its accumulated cash reserves. It ran out of capacity to expand cellular services nearly 18 months ago, and no new major contracts for mobile networks and equipment have been awarded in the past 24 months. On Wednesday, the PSU’s board decided to put its $10 billion tender (which has already been delayed by over an year) on hold after the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) had launched a fresh probe into ‘irregularities’ since guidelines forbid post-tender negotiations with successful bidders. Sweden’s Ericsson had emerged as the lowest bidder in the North and South East zones while China’s Huawei was selected for the South and West Zones. Meanwhile, in a related development, the umbrella body representing all employee unions of BSNL has threatened to launch an agitation against the telco’s move to put the tender the hold. “We have gone on strike in the past against delays to expansion plans, and we will decide within the next two days if the unions will adopt a similar strategy. We have been talks with the BSNL management and the DoT on this issue and are extremely upset with the latest decision,” explained VAN Namboodiri, general secretary, BSNL employees unions. BSNL’s performance has been slipping for the last three years. In 2005, BSNL added more subscribers than Bharti Airtel and by mid-2006, it was almost within striking distance of occupying the top slot in mobile customers. BSNL’s first tender for 63 million lines in 2006, then the world’s largest, was delayed after Motorola went to court. The US-based networks company later withdrew the case, but this tender was finally reduced to a mere 13 million lines after telecoms minister A Raja intervened. To overcome this, BSNL in May 2008 floated the 93 million lines GSM tender. This time around, Nokia Siemens Networks, which was disqualified on technical grounds approached the CVC and also filed cases in multiple courts. After months of delay, in August 2009, BSNL overcame two major challenges — the ‘integrity panel’ set up with the permission from CVC as well as the Andhra Pradesh High Court ruled that the telco was justified in disqualifying NSN because it did not meet technical requirements. As reported first by ET last week, the dismal showing by BSNL in 2008-09 resulted in the telco ceding the top slot for sales and profits to private sector rival Bharti Airtel for the first time ever. It also means that BSNL’s valuations will suffer as it prepares for its first public share offering. For the year-ended March 2009, BSNL posted a net profit of Rs 574.85 crore on total revenues of Rs 35,811.92 crore. Profits had nose-dived 81% and revenues fell 6% when compared to the year-ago period. This is the second successive year that BSNL witnessed a massive fall in profits despite being one of the largest players in the world's fastest-growing telecoms market. In comparison, Bharti Airtel’s revenues grew by over Rs 10,000 crore during 2008-09 and its revenues jumped from Rs 27,012 crore for the fiscal ended March 2008 to Rs 37,352 crore for the year-ended March 2009. During this period, its profits increased to Rs 7,859 crore when compared to Rs 6,395 crore for the year-ended March 2008.","The Prime Minister’s Office is poised to address BSNL's issues as it suspends its 93 million lines GSM tender due to a fresh probe by the Central Vigilance Commission. BSNL has faced operating losses and capacity limitations, with no significant contracts awarded in 24 months. The telecom giant's performance decline led to Bharti Airtel surpassing it in sales and profits for the first time in 2008-09. BSNL's net profit fell drastically despite being a major player in India's telecom market. The PSU's decision sparked union threats of agitation, highlighting the urgency of resolving BSNL's challenges.",Technology and Gadgets,2010-01-01 00:00:00
Doctors struggle to cure malaria,"MUMBAI: After three bouts of malaria in 11 months, city resident Sarita Seshan has been left without a job and with scepticism of modern medicineâ€™s ability to combat malaria. Each time she came down with the infection, it took long and complicated diagnoses, and multiple rounds of different drugs before her fever finally subsided. â€œMalaria finds mention in Vedic texts of 1600 BC,â€™â€™ mused Seshan. â€œHowever, its cure, still seems a challenge.â€™â€™ Cases like hers are on the rise as treatment of malaria becomes increasingly complicated. Many of the complications stem from changes in plasmodium, the parasite that causes the disease. For one, there has been an increase in plasmodium falciparum, a species that causes cerebral malaria. Till about a decade ago, this species accounted for only 20 per cent of malaria infections in the city. Falciparum infections can be fatal. The remaining 80 per cent of malaria infections were caused by the less lethal plasmodium vivax. However, new data collected at the KEM Hospital and anecdotal evidence from private practitioners in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai indicate that falciparum now accounts for 30 to 40 per cent of malaria infections in the city. The problem is compounded by falciparumâ€™s resistance to common anti-malarial drugs. Studies from the KEM Hospital indicate that over 50 per cent of plasmodium falciparum cases in Mumbai are resistant to chloroquine, which is the first-line treatment recommended by the national malaria control programme.In addition, there have been reported cases of falciparum resistance to other common anti-malarials such as artemisinin, primaquine, sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine. Despite the steadily increasing drug resistance, public health experts do not recommend abandoning chloroquine. â€œThe majority of malaria infections in Mumbai are still caused by plasmodium vivax, which is sensitive to chloroquine,â€™â€™ explained N.A. Kshirsagar, dean of KEM Hospital. Doctors are quick to add that treatment with chloroquine demands close followup to ensure that patients.complete their full dose and that they respond adequately to the drug. However, multiple studies reveal irrational and indiscriminate use of anti-malarials. â€œPrivate doctors especially are under pressure to show quick results or else the patient will go to another physician. This market pressure coupled with patientsâ€™ often unrealistic expectations prompt doctors to switch drugs rapidly without completing full doses,â€™â€™ said Chandana Behl, private physician and a public health activist in Navi Mumbai. While resistance to existing anti-malarial drugs grows, there are few new drugs that are affordable and easy to administer. Shobhona Sharma, a molecular biologist at the Tata Institute Fundamental Research who works on malaria, added that the prospect of malaria vaccines also remains bleak because not enough is known about the workings of the pathogen. â€œMosquito nets are the best option at this stage. The idea is not to get bitten,â€™â€™ Sharma said","Malaria cases in Mumbai rise due to increasing prevalence of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, causing complications and fatalities. Resistance to common anti-malarials like chloroquine poses challenges despite its continued use. Private doctors face pressure to switch drugs quickly, leading to incomplete treatments. Limited affordable alternatives and bleak prospects for malaria vaccines exacerbate the situation. Mosquito nets are recommended as the primary preventive measure.",Health and Wellness,2002-08-20 00:00:00
Youtube helps young entrepreneur from EGH achieve success,"TURA: A young entrepreneur from a village under Songsak in East Garo Hills has achieved success after he embarked on a lively hood venture merely by watching videos of mushrooms being cultivated on Youtube. Meet Panchiang Marak from Tebil Bonegre village who by watching youtube videos began his own cultivation in his own house to earn some money. Although his first two attempts in farming the edible fungi did not achieve the desired result, Marak never gave up and he was able to see significant success on his third try. East Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Swapnil Tembe recently visited the young entrepreneur in his home to get a better understanding of the hardships he faced and to encourage him to carry on with the money generating activity. Speaking during his interaction with the DC, Panchiang said that as he is currently unemployed, he was always looking for ways to earn some money when he came across a video of mushrooms being cultivated on Youtube. “I saw a video of people cultivating mushrooms on Youtube and decided to give it a try as I had nothing better to do the whole day. It looked easy as there was no big investment involved,” Marak said. Although, he did not have to invest a large amount of money, Marak said that he had to sell his motorcycle. “I decided to sell my only motorcycle for Rs 60,000/-. But during negotiations, it was scaled down to Rs 45,000/- and It was with this money that I was able to start my venture,” Marak said. Marak learnt through trial and error and he was not satisfied with the results of his first two tries. However, he persisted trying to make various improvements and was quite happy with the results on his third attempt, although he feels there is still room for further improvement. While Marak is yet to reap the profits of his venture through sale so far, he is hopeful that the activity will help him to earn a living in the future. Meanwhile, in his message to the younger generation, Marak urged them not to waste time in the social media but to put the internet to good use to help them to make something productive. “I do not have social media accounts like Facebook. I use WhatApp but that is only to gather necessary information. My advice to other young people is to make use of the information provided in the internet to improve their lives instead of wasting time,” Marak said.","A young entrepreneur from Songsak village in East Garo Hills, Panchiang Marak, has successfully started a mushroom cultivation venture by watching videos on YouTube.

"Kejriwal did the right thing, say supporters","There was a palpable sense of finality among hundreds of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supporters outside the party’s Hanuman Road office on Friday evening. A majority of those present had regrets neither about the longevity of ‘their’ government nor about the party’s future course of action -- the much-awaited march down the road to the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Having adorned their signature white caps and wielding brooms, a handful climbed atop walls in the vicinity while most thronged the narrow central Delhi street - the very street where they had counted down to the AAP’s unexpected electoral victory a little less than a month ago. “What he did was correct - there was simply no other way,” said Rajnish Kumar, an auto-rickshaw driver-cum-supporter. “In however little time we were able to spend in government, we have been able to expose both the BJP as well as the Congress in addition to proving our own mettle.” Mohammad Rasool, a private executive, said, “This is just payback for the AAP daring to raise its voice against biggies. The nation knows the difference between clean and corrupt governance now, at least and will be able to make a better choice in the Lok Sabha elections.” Among the 200 to 300 supporters present, flash mobs of sorts would erupt in slogans every now and then with each raising a different one as a small contingent of the police kept a safe distance. These ranged from the oft-used ‘Inquilaab Zindabad’ (Long live the Revolution) to more novel ones such as “Bharat Maa ka alsi laal - Kejriwal, Kejriwal” (Mother India’s real son - Kejriwal, Kejriwal” to “Shaheed lade the goron se, hum ladenge choron se,” (The martyrs had fought the white colonial masters, we will now fight the thieves.” The crowd erupted in applause as soon as Kejriwal reached the office to declare his resolve to quit around 8:15 pm with a 15-minute address minced with appreciation following. “If Kejriwalji hadn’t taken the course that he has, he would have lost a lot of support on the ground,” said Ila Gupta after Kejriwal left to submit his resignation to Lieutenant General (L-G) Najeeb Jung. “It was essentially do-or-die for us. This sacrifice will go a long way for his loyal support base,” she said.

Headteacher bans children from using improper enunciation,"THE news that a primary school headteacher sent a letter home to parents telling them when to correct their children’s speech has caused some consternation. Carol Walker, the head of Middlesbrough’s Sacred Heart Primary, advised parents to correct phrases like “I dunno” to “I don’t know” and “yous” to “you” lest their children be disadvantaged in job interviews. Was this the social engineering of a middle-class teacher (albeit one from Stockton-on-Tees) trying to destroy centuries of local dialectal tradition? Or a completely justified attempt to improve her children’s grammar? Sadly, for any defensive Teesiders, most of Walker’s points were valid — what teacher worth their salt wouldn’t correct “I done that” to “I have done that”? But several of Walker’s suggestions wade into the murky, elastic territory of proper word pronunciation, too. Who’s to say why a clipped received pronunciation of a word is of any more worth than a Middlesbrough eight-year-old’s learned interpretation? John Prescott, the former Deputy PM who has lived in South Yorkshire, Cheshire and Hull (he was born in Wales) is sceptical. “I quite understand why she feels she wants to say that but it’s the justification — namely, that you won’t get a job if you talk with a northern accent — that’s curious,” he says. Speaking proper may help you get ahead in the world but there’s a certain charm to dialect misuses that — so long as people learn to differentiate when writing — you can’t help but love. For instance, one of Walker’s banned phrases is the charming northern “gizit ‘ere” for “give it to me” (my school playground preferred “gimme it”). The school also advises correcting “werk” and “shert” to “work” and “shirt” and “letta” to “letter”, which are simply the kids’ accents. Ridiculous. Leave them be. If people aren’t being employed on the basis of having an accent then it’s probably the company’s fault and not the bairns’. Us northerners get a lot of this and —frankly — a rebellion is due, it’s time to start correcting southerners. If I had a pound for every time someone stared at me blankly for saying “bath” with a hard “a” rather than the weirdo southern pronunciation “barth”, I’d have enough to fill a barthtub. And, despite a natural dulling of my own Mancunian/Lancastrian tones, thank to a decade of living darn sarf, I’m still regularly corrected on my own pronunciations by southern colleagues on certain words (for the record, guys, the ‘oo’ in ‘room’ would suggest that it’s room and not ‘rum’). But do strong accents make us sound dumb? Research from Bath Spa University in 2008 suggested not and that the Yorkshire twang was more intelligent sounding than even received pronunciation, so any early age tinkering might have the opposite effect to the one desired. So hey, teachers, leave those kids alone!","A primary school headteacher's letter advising parents to correct their children's speech has sparked debate over the value of regional dialects versus standard grammar. While some argue for the importance of teaching proper grammar for future job prospects, others defend the charm and cultural significance of dialects. Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott questions the justification for linking accent with job opportunities. The article highlights the tension between linguistic diversity and societal norms, with the author advocating for the preservation of regional accents and expressions. Criticism is directed at the idea that accents reflect intelligence, with research suggesting that regional accents can be perceived as intelligent or even superior to received pronunciation. The piece calls for acceptance and celebration of linguistic diversity, rather than imposition of standardized language norms.",Education,2013-02-12 00:00:00

The amount was distributed to secured creditors late last month as a settlement for their dues from Rapid MetroRail Gurgaon South (RMGSL), three people familiar with the process said. Secured creditors received a total of about ₹1,300 crore for their dues totalling ₹1,500 crore, a recovery of 87%.

Pakistani gov't in dire straits as key party quits,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's prime minister, scrambling to keep his party's grip on power, sought support from opposition leaders Monday following the defection of a key coalition partner that threatens to bring down the government. The Muttahida Qaumi Movement, the second largest party in the ruling coalition, said Sunday it would join the opposition, leaving Premier Yousuf Raza Gilani's government short of majority support in parliament. The political crisis could distract the government from its alliance with the U.S. against Islamist militants in neighboringAfghanistan, though security is largely the purview of the powerful military. But the turmoil also all but guarantees lawmakers will make no progress anytime soon on solving the critical economic problems that have forced the country torely on $11 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund. For ordinary Pakistanis, it's inflation, chronic power outages and other daily hardships that are the biggest concern. Failure to make gains on such domestic issues does not bode well for the long-term stability of this impoverished, nuclear-armed nation. On New Year's eve, Gilani's government announced hikes in gas and heating oil prices, angering many _ and giving the MQM another reason to part ways with the ruling Pakistan People's Party. ``The petrol bomb the government has dropped on the people of Pakistan has forced our party to part ways with such insane decisions,'' said Faisal Subzwari, an MQM leader. The party on Monday filed an application to formally switch to the opposition. Its Cabinet ministers already tendered their resignations last week. Another, smaller party, the Jamiat Ulema Islam, announced in December it would switch tothe opposition and its application is under process. Without the two, the ruling coalition will fall short of the 172 seats needed to keep a majority. Ruling party leaders said they were trying to work out their differences with the MQM, and Gilani said he was confident the government could maintain its majority. The prime minister met with the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Q on Monday afternoon. Earlier in the day, staterun Pakistan Television said the prime minister held talks with a top official in the leading opposition party, the PakistanMuslim League-N. If Gilani's government cannot retain its majority coalition or cobble together a new one, it could face a no-confidence vote and midterm elections. Analysts said the ruling party had only weeks, if not days, to shore up support and prevent the government's collapse. However, poor relations between the MQM and the PML-N, headed by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, give the ruling party some breathing space because the opposition could be too fractured to oust the prime minister. Sharif's party also would be loath to try to take the reins of a new government at such a difficult time, said Hasan AskariRizvi, a political analyst. The IMF has demanded that Pakistan significantly reform its economy, including slashing its deficit, in order to keep theloan program going. The international assistance took on added importance after the massive floods of late 2010 that affected some 20 million people. But the economic reforms, notably a revised general sales tax, are unpopular and have given the opposition _ as well as the MQM and the JUI _ something to rail against. Many analysts speculate the parties could be using the crisis as a tacticto win concessions from the ruling party. The MQM even raised the possibility on Monday that it might quit its partnership with the PPP in the coalition that governs Sindh province, putting even more pressure on the ruling party. The lack of progress and political bickering has upset many Pakistanis. ``There is no electricity, no gas, no jobs and they are fighting one another,'' said Arif Fasiullah, 35, of the central city of Multan, in a recent interview. ``They do not pass any legislation. They just do dirty politics.'' The inflation rate in Pakistan is above 15 percent, according to government statistics, and the poorest are feeling the painmost. Tahir Khan, 25, a laborer in the northwest city of Peshawar, said it has become harder to feed his family of six. ``I do not care what one leader says about the other. I am more concerned which leader gives us what,'' he said. The PPP took power in February 2008 in elections that brought Pakistan out of nearly a decade of military rule. It rode topower on a wave of sympathy after its leader, Benazir Bhutto, was assassinated. But its popularity has slipped as Pakistan has grappled with severe economic problems and frequent militant attacks. The PML-N holds the second largest number of seats in parliament and is believed to be the most popular party in the country. It is more aligned with religious conservatives than the PPP is and has not been as vocal in opposing the Taliban _ a position that could cause some discomfort in Washington, which needs Pakistan's help in ending the war in neighboringAfghanistan. One unclear factor is where the military stands on the latest political wrangling. Army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani is reported to be unhappy with the current leadership, but not enthusiastic about its possible replacement. The army, under the leadership of retired Gen. Pervez Musharraf, ousted the PML-N's Sharif, who was then prime minister, in a coup in 1999. But Kayani has not indicated any interest in staging a coup if the currentgovernment is toppled.","Pakistan’s government is in crisis as the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), a key coalition partner, joined the opposition, leaving Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani’s administration short of a majority in parliament. The MQM’s exit was triggered by public anger over hikes in gas and heating oil prices. Another coalition member, Jamiat Ulema Islam (JUI), had also left recently, worsening the ruling Pakistan People’s Party’s (PPP) situation. Without these allies, the government risks a no-confidence vote and possible midterm elections. The political instability could impact the government’s focus on economic reforms required by the IMF for an $11 billion loan and efforts in the fight against militancy. Despite public frustrations over inflation, unemployment, and power shortages, the opposition remains divided, providing some temporary relief to the PPP. Analysts suggest the opposition may use this crisis as leverage for concessions, rather than an immediate ousting of the government. While military intervention is unlikely, the situation remains fragile. Public discontent grows as the government struggles to address critical economic issues, diverting attention from the daily hardships faced by ordinary Pakistanis.",Politics,2011-01-03 00:00:00
Signs your current skincare isn’t meeting your skin’s needs,"Image Source: Instagram In the midst of the global skincare boom, it’s easy to get swept up in the allure of heavily marketed products with glowing online reviews. We often assume that the higher the price tag, the better the results. However, crafting a current effective skincare routine shouldn’t be about following trends or chasing after the most hyped products; it’s about finding what truly works for your unique skin type and needs. Not all products are universal, and factors like environmental exposure, lifestyle, and diet play a significant role in determining what will suit your skin best. Consider this scenario: You invest in a pricey moisturizer boasting promises of a radiant, even skin tone, based on rave reviews from a friend. Yet, despite diligently using up bottle after bottle, you notice little to no difference in your complexion. Sound familiar? Many of us have been there, stuck in a skincare routine that fails to deliver results. While a product may work wonders for someone else, it doesn’t guarantee the same outcome for you. Why? Because everyone’s skin is unique. While we can’t provide a one-size-fits-all solution, we can offer guidance on recognizing signs that your current skincare regimen might not be the right fit for you. 1. Constant Acne Breakouts: One telltale sign that your skincare routine is off-track is persistent acne or sudden breakouts. Using products unsuitable for your skin can exacerbate dryness, leading to flare-ups. It may also indicate that your cleanser isn’t effectively removing dirt and grime, contributing to ongoing zits. 2. Excessive Skin Dryness: There’s a fine line between clean skin and overly stripped skin. If your face feels tight and “squeaky clean” after washing, you may be over-cleansing, stripping away natural oils that protect your skin. Combat dryness by opting for hydrating products, such as those containing hyaluronic acid. 3. Sensitivity and Irritation: Using the wrong skincare products can trigger heightened sensitivity and irritation. Always perform a patch test before introducing new products, especially if you have sensitive or dry skin. Constantly switching products disrupts your skin’s equilibrium, resulting in redness, dehydration, and increased sensitivity. 4. Increased Hyperpigmentation: Notice any discolored patches on your skin? Hyperpigmentation can be a sign that your current skincare regimen isn’t suitable for your skin. While sun exposure plays a role, it can also stem from using products with ingredients that don’t agree with your skin. In conclusion, before diving into a skincare routine, consult a dermatologist to determine your skin type. Remember, quality skincare isn’t about the price tag; prioritize products that are chemical-free, vegan, and tailored to your skin type. Opt for sustainably produced options that prioritize your skin’s health above all else.","The article emphasizes the importance of creating a personalized skincare routine based on individual skin types and needs, highlighting signs that indicate a current routine may not be suitable. The signs include constant acne breakouts, excessive skin dryness, sensitivity, irritation, and increased hyperpigmentation. The article advises consulting a dermatologist for personalized recommendations and prioritizing products that are chemical-free, vegan, and tailored to one's skin type.",Lifestyle and Features,2024-02-22 00:00:00
CBI books own DySP For taking ‘undue advantage’ from people probed by him,"THE CBI has booked one of its own deputy SPs posted in the Bank Security and Frauds branch in Mumbai for allegedly taking “undue advantage” from people probed by him, officials said on Thursday. The FIR registered by the agency against Meena alleges he was utilising the services of middlemen for transacting the bribe money through a web of accounts and hawala channel, they said. Deputy SP BM Meena was booked for allegedly obtaining undue advantage from different individuals who were within the ambit of the investigation being conducted by him. The CBI follows a zero tolerance policy to corruption and other misdemeanour, and takes action against erring officers immediately, they said.

9 sample collection buses hit the road in Anantapur,"Backward Classes Welfare Minister Malagundla Sankaranarayana formally flagged off nine i-MASQ (Intelligence Monitoring Analysis Service Quarantine) sample collection vans here on Tuesday to speed up testing of COVID swab samples. The district accounted for 153 new cases and three deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of positive cases to 2,481 cases. Of these, 1,443 patients have been discharged. Kurnool district, which has the most number of COVID-19 cases in the State at 2,671, reported 84 new cases in the last 24 hours taking the number of active cases to 1268. The number of patients discharged in Kurnool till Monday evening stood at 1,318. The total number of cases are only those of local origin, and do not take into account people who tested positive in the district but hail from other States and countries. Mr. Sankaranarayana asked people on Tuesday to exercise greater caution during ‘Unlock 2.0’ and help the government contain the spread of coronavirus, and pointed out that the State was doing all it could to keep people safe and treat the COVID-19 patients. “Andhra Pradesh is doing the maximum number of tests in the country, and Anantapur too has conducted 75,000 samples so far and has been testing at the rate of 2,000 samples per day on an average for the past one week,” said District Collector Gandham Chandrudu. “The special vans for collection of COVID-19 samples would ramp up the testing process in the district,” said Anantapur Urban MLA Anantha Venkatarami Reddy while flagging off the vehicles at Neeru Pragathi Park in Sri Nagar Colony in the city. “While the restrictions on movement have been relaxed, people should behave responsibly and come out of their houses only if essential and report to health workers about any symptoms, so that early testing can be done and treatment started. Testing would be done for high-risk groups and those having breathing problems or oxygen saturation less than 95% after walking for 100 yards,” Mr. Gandham Chandrudu said. Joint Collector (VWS&D) A. Siri said that the district administration will hold a meeting with owners of accredited private medical laboratories on Wednesday for starting COVID-19 tests in Anantapur district.","Andhra Pradesh's Backward Classes Welfare Minister Malagundla Sankaranarayana launched nine i-MASQ vans to speed up COVID-19 sample collection in Anantapur district, which reported 153 new cases and three deaths.

"Mars' 'missing' water is buried beneath surface, says study","Early Mars was thought to have enough water to cover the whole planet in roughly 100 to 1,500 meters (330 to 4,4920 feet) of ocean.Billions of years ago, Mars was home to lakes and oceans -- but where all the water went to transform the planet into the desolate rock we know today has been something of a mystery. Using observations made by Mars rovers as well as of meteorites from the planet, the team focused on hydrogen, a key component of water.(AP) Using observations made by Mars rovers as well as of meteorites from the planet, the team focused on hydrogen, a key component of water.(AP) Most of it was thought to have been lost to space, but a new study funded by NASA proposes that it didn't go anywhere but is trapped within minerals in the crust. ""We're saying that the crust forms what we call hydrated minerals, so minerals that actually have water in their crystal structure,"" Eva Scheller, lead author of the new paper in Science, told AFP. In fact, Scheller's model suggests anywhere between 30 - 99 percent of the initial water remains trapped inside these minerals. Early Mars was thought to have enough water to cover the whole planet in roughly 100 to 1,500 meters (330 to 4,4920 feet) of ocean. Because the planet lost its magnetic field early in its history, its atmosphere was progressively stripped away, and it was assumed this was how it lost its water. But the authors of the new study believe that while some of the water did disappear, the majority remained. Using observations made by Mars rovers as well as of meteorites from the planet, the team focused on hydrogen, a key component of water. There are different kinds of hydrogen atoms. Most have just one proton in their nucleus, but a tiny fraction, about 0.02 percent, have both a proton and a neutron, making them heavier. These are known as deuterium, or ""heavy"" hydrogen. Also watch: EJ Espresso: Odisha forest fire; NASA releases sounds of laser shots on Mars Because the lighter kind escapes the planet's atmosphere at a faster rate, the loss of most of the water to space would leave relatively more deuterium behind. But given how much water the planet is believed to have started with, and the current rate of hydrogen escape observed by spacecraft, the current deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio cannot be explained by atmospheric loss alone. - Permanent loss - The study's authors instead say there was a combination of two mechanisms: the trapping of water in minerals in the planet's crust as well as the loss of water to the atmosphere. ""Anytime that you have a rock and it's interacting with water, there's a series of very complex reactions that form a hydrated mineral,"" said Scheller. This process, called ""chemical weathering,"" also takes place on Earth -- for example, in clay, also found on Mars. But on our planet volcanoes recycle the water back into the atmosphere. Mars, however, doesn't have tectonic plates, making the changes permanent. According to the teams' simulations, the planet lost between most of its water between four to 3.7 billion years ago, which means ""Mars was pretty much like we see how it is today for the past three billion years,"" said Scheller. She added she was excited about what the Perseverance rover, which landed last month for a multiyear science mission on the planet, might be able to contribute to the area of research. ""The Perseverance rover is actually going to investigate exactly these processes and reactions that cause the sequestration of water in the crust,"" she said. The team's model contains multiple scenarios, which they to compare to new data acquired by the rover. ""We can start to say, 'These parts of the model aren't working right and these parts are' and that's going to help us get closer and closer and closer to the answer,"" said Scheller.","A study funded by NASA suggests that much of Mars' water may still be trapped within minerals in its crust, challenging the previous belief that most of it was lost to space. The research proposes that 30-99% of the initial water on early Mars remains trapped in hydrated minerals. While atmospheric loss did occur due to the planet's early loss of its magnetic field, the majority of water might have been retained.

Candidate alleges dept of delaying appointment,"One Lobom Lida, who cleared the recent written examination for the post of Junior Librarian in the Department of Secondary Education, claimed that the department has been delaying his appointment and instead placed him in the waiting list. Armed with RTI documents which show the validity of Lida’s claim that he should have been appointed, the candidate in a press conference said that he has been running from pillar to post for the last five months without any success. He informed that an eight-member committee constituted by the Directorate of Secondary Education on July 10 under the chairmanship of SCERT Director, Moto Nyori also unanimously pronounced their findings in his favour, but the concerned authorities are yet to appoint him. “Everyone from the Director to Education Minister says that I have been wronged but no one is taking any action on it. I have been pursuing concerned authorities for justice for over five months and now I have lost my patience”, said Lida. “I was given zero for paragraph writing by the evaluators. I can accept that my writing may not have been up to their expectations, but how can they not give me marks for the correct answer in objective question?” said Lida. Lida informed that his answer sheet obtained through RTI documents clearly shows that he has not been marked even for his right answer against one objective question, and that the candidate who got selected in the third position has secured only 0.10 more marks than him. Also citing the illegal appointments done during the recruitment of various posts for teachers, Lida said that if the department can go to the extent of violating the High Court’s directives and appoint several waiting list candidates then why were they reluctant to appoint a genuine candidate.","Lobom Lida, a candidate who cleared the recent written examination for the post of Junior Librarian in the Department of Secondary Education, alleged that despite qualifying, the department has delayed his appointment and placed him on the waiting list.

Mixed bag of Indian artists at 4th Art Basel in Hong Kong,"The four Indian galleries participating at the three-day-long fair that concluded on March 26 included Mumbai-based Chemould Prescott Road, Delhi-based Vadehra Art Gallery and Nature Morte and Kolkata-based Experimenter. Galleries from India showcased a mixed bag of veteran and new artists at the 4th edition of Art Basel, Hong Kong with leading contemporaries like Ravinder Reddy, Atul and Anju Dodiya being represented alongside newer names of Faig Ahmed, Ayesha Sultana and Rathin Barman. The four Indian galleries participating at the three-day-long fair that concluded on March 26 included Mumbai-based Chemould Prescott Road, Delhi-based Vadehra Art Gallery and Nature Morte and Kolkata-based Experimenter. The extravagant fair which kicked off amid rainy weather and was attended among others by Oscar winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio, featured 239 galleries drawn from 35 countries. Vadehra Art Gallery (VAG) which had on display artworks symbolic of India’s rich history, particularly from the British era was visibly flooded by art connoiseurs and sold Atul Dodiya’s rendition of “The Garden Party – February 1925” which was organised by ruler of Rajkot in honour of Mahatma Gandhi, within hours of the show’s private opening on March 22. Riyas Komu’s portrait of Mahatma Gandhi looking dapper in his black barrister uniform holding a plate with the date – 9/11/1906 – signifying the non-violence movement launched by British Indians in South Africa, was another immensely popular work at the gallery. “We have been coming with the same artists but with new works. I think the focus in this fair is more contemporary, so we bring all our star contemporary artists like Atul Dodiya, Anju Dodiya, Shilpa Gupta, Riyas Komu, Jagannath Panda,” Roshni Vadehra, Director, VAG said. Other exhibits at VAG included a series of charcoal paintings titled “Penal Colony” by Kerala film maker KM Madhusudhanan, two of Odiya artist Jagannath Panda’s latest works – “The Gaze” and “Virtues of a Hero,” Ravinder Reddy’s iconic head sculpture of a woman along with two brand new sculptures of “Man” and “Nandi” by Arun Kumar H G among others. The collection put out by Nature Morte at the Art Basel sattelite fair this year comprised of “younger artists” unlike previous editions, when the gallery showcased global artists like Subodh Gupta and Bharti Kher. Peter Nagy, gallery Director said, “The prices of Subodh Gupta and Bharti Kher are so high that we don’t sell it here. So, this time we have brought younger artists with lower prices, because we feel that’s what the markets are for here.” Engravings by Pakistani artist Seher Shah, one of Suhasini Kejriwal’s “fake” paintings, Faig Ahmed’s carpet works were among the few works on display at the gallery booth. While Kolkata-based Kejriwal’s painting made of embroidery work superimposed with photographs to make a collage was a fresh work created for the fair, Ahmed’s carpet pieces were borrowed from an earlier set of works by the artist, Nagy said. Chemould Prescott Road, owned by Shireen Gandhy, who has been on the selection committe at ABHK, exhibited Gigi Scaria’s “Shadow of the Ancestors,” a series of architectural sketches on cement sheets by Studio Mumbai’s Bijoy Jain and a pair of cane sculptures by Shakuntala Kulkarni among other artworks. The gallery also included works by Anju Dodiya. Kolkata-based Experimenter, which has previously showcased foreign artists at the fair, this year represented Bengali artist Rathin Barman and Pakistani artist Ayesha Sultana. The gallery was participating in the ‘Discoveries’ sector of the fair, which explains the choice of younger and newer artists. Barman’s indigenous sculptures and sketches recalled the plight of those who were displaced after the partition of Bengal, their struggle to “build homes overnight” and their over five-decade-long wait to be rehabilitated in West Bengal. His works at the fair comprised of three sets of work – a series of miniature house structures made out of concrete and iron-rods, a series of architectural sketches and a fibre-glass map of undivided Bengal. “This project is about the migration from Bangladesh to India during partition. Most of the Hindu middle class from Bangladesh were forced to migrate,” Barman, who spent a few months living with the migrants in Shyamnagar, a small town in the outskirts of Kolkata, said. Also, on display were a a few sketches of unmaterialised maps, that were orginally charted out by the then government to distribute land to the migrants for their rehabilitation. “I chose the colour rust because these plans never happened in realities,” the artist said.","The 4th edition of Art Basel, Hong Kong featured Indian galleries showcasing a blend of established and emerging artists. Mumbai's Chemould Prescott Road, Delhi's Vadehra Art Gallery and Nature Morte, and Kolkata's Experimenter participated.

SATC 2 fails to click with ladies,"Even before the last one could release, there were talks of a sequel and ladies lunching all across the globe had their feathers in a twist already. Yes, we are talking of the fearsome foursome who started a worldwide cosmopolitan frenzy only to ditch it mid-way as “when everyone started drinking it, we stopped”, made it acceptable to wear a bird in your head before Lady Gaga and proved giant flowers could be awesome brooches. Sex and the City’s second offering recently released and as one had already heard, the ubiquitous city was nowhere in sight. Richa Wadhera, a copywriter with a DRAFT FCB ULKA felt the opulence was a bit much ridiculous for a movie whose entire premise was about New York City. “They took the movie to Abu Dhabi and there too, the drama wasn’t enough. The girl bonding moments, the reason why I went to see it with the girls, were missing. The sparkle didn’t lack in Carrie’s marriage but in the film instead,” she says. Entrepreneur and a fan of the series, Thenny Mejia calls the film one big fashion show that shows nothing. “There was no story whatsoever and the relationship between them was just too mechanical,” she says clearly displaying her disappointment in the second instalment. Aditi Surie, a sociology student at the Delhi School of Economics disliked the humour that went from being satirical to in your face and obnoxious. “ The MEN who used to be all important in the series and even in the first movie to an extent were just acting dummies. It ended up being pointless, a movie that achieved nothing,” she tells us.","The release of ""Sex and the City 2"" was highly anticipated, but the film received mixed reviews. Fans like Richa Wadhera criticized the film for its excessive opulence and lack of focus on New York City, a key element of the series. Thenny Mejia felt the film was more of a fashion show with no real story or genuine relationship dynamics. Aditi Surie pointed out the shift in humor from satirical to obnoxious and the reduced significance of the male characters, describing the movie as ultimately pointless.

Greg Shipperd, who coaches the Indian Premiere League team Delhi Daredevils and also Victoria Bushrangers in Australia, said he would use his influence with the Indian players to send a strong message to the Indian students that Australia is a better place to live and study in. “If they cannot come personally, I can get their messages recorded and play them.

Sensex up 847 points as global indices rally on US eco data,"MUMBAI: The sensex reversed its three-session losing streak with an 847-point rally on Monday on the back of a strong rally in the US markets on Friday night as heavyweights like Reliance Industries, Infosys and TCS contributed the most to the index’s gains. The sensex gained 1. 4% to close at 60,747 points. The Nifty too gained 1. 4%, or 242 points, to close at 18,101. The rally on Wall Street came on the back of a set of economic data that raised expectations that the US Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, may not raise rates as aggressively as it did in the past few months.This led to a global rally in stocks. As a result, of the 30 sensex constituents, 27 closed with gains. Interestingly foreign funds were strong sellers of Indian stocks with anet outflow worth Rs 203 crore, BSE data showed. Domestic funds, on the other hand, were net buyers at Rs 1,724 crore. The day’s rally also added Rs 3. 3 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 285. 5 lakh crore. According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, domestic equities saw some support-based buying after witnessing selling pressure last week, largely helped by a rally in global markets. Except stocks from consumer durables space, buying was visible across sectors with IT, metals, PSU banks and auto being top gainers. “Expectation of the US Fed turning less hawkish and opening of remaining Covid-related border controls by both Hong Kong and China uplifted investors’ sentiments. ” Technically, the Nifty has to be above 18,000-18,050 zone for the current rally to sustain, Samco Securities technical analyst Rohan Patil wrote in a post-market note. This could take the index towards the 18,250-18,300 zone, whereas support for the Nifty is placed at 17,800, Patil wrote. Going forward, investors will also keep an eye on US, Europe and India’s inflation data, expected during the week, Khemka said. “Further, Fed chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Tuesday will be important for global markets as it could throw some light for future action. ” Some other dealers also expect the quarterly earnings numbers by some of the large companies, expected over the next two weeks, would also impact the market’s trend.","On the stock market front, 27 out of 30 Sensex constituents closed with gains despite strong foreign fund selling, with domestic funds being net buyers. The rally added Rs 3.3 lakh crore to investors’ wealth, reaching a market capitalization of Rs 285.5 lakh crore. Global market rally and easing Covid border controls boosted sentiment. Technical analysis suggests Nifty needs to sustain above 18,000-18,050 levels, targeting 18,250-18,300, with support at 17,800.

Cinema shouldn’t be limited to one kind of storytelling’: Don Palathara,"Even among independent filmmakers, Don Palathara is an outlier. His latest film Family premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2023 and travelled to festivals including the Bengaluru International Film Festival, the International Film Festival of India, and the International Film Festival of Kerala. Starring Vinay Forrt and Divya Prabha among a talented ensemble, Family will have a theatrical release on February 23, 2024, and in the run-up to that, director Anurag Kashyap released the trailer on January 27 at an event in Kerala. But Palathara had promised to be at Film Society Bhubaneswar’s 13th Indian Film Festival with the film. So, he missed this event in Kerala—the first of its kind in his career of independent films that had no theatrical releases—to honour his commitment to the film society in Odisha. It is rare to see a filmmaker living up to his word, let alone to a modest community of film lovers. At the festival, he blended into the crowd, and one could not tell if he was an attendee or a filmmaker. He shared his wisdom with the mostly young audience made of students and later sat down with this writer for an hour of conversation. Palathara has made six features in a span of eight years. His first film Shavam (2015) revolves around a funeral and the commotion, community, and camaraderie within. Vith (2017), his sophomore effort, captures everyday life in the mofussil that turns into a menacing stare into the abyss. The third film, 1956, Central Travancore (2019), is about brothers who go into the forest to hunt for a gaur.","Independent filmmaker Don Palathara’s latest film Family premiered internationally and will release theatrically in February 2024.

"Phelps banned for six months, no 2015 worlds","Michael Phelps, the 18-time Olympic swim champion arrested last week for drunk driving, was banned for six months by USA Swimming and dropped from the 2015 World Championships. Monday's punishments came six days after Phelps was apprehended by police in his hometown of Baltimore and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, excessive speed and crossing the center line while driving inside a tunnel. On Sunday, Phelps said on Twitter that he would be taking a break from swimming and ""take some time away to attend a program"" for treatment of unspecified personal issues. In announcing sanctions against the Olympic superstar, USA Swimming executive director Chuck Wielgus said Phelps' actions required ""significant consequences."" ""Michael has publicly acknowledged the impact of his decisions, his accountability especially due to his stature in the sport and the steps necessary for self-improvement,"" Wielgus said. ""We endorse and are here to fully support his personal development actions."" The discipline meted out, which includes forfeiture of Phelps' funding from the federation for six months, is based on USA Swimming rules that prohibit conduct ""detrimental to the image or reputation"" of USA Swimming or the sport. Phelps will still be allowed to train with his club, but cannot compete in USA Swimming-sanctioned competitions through March 6, 2015. According to the federation, Phelps has agreed that he will not represent the United States at the World Championships on August 2-9 in Kazan, Russia. The worlds were expected to provide a key measure of whether Phelps' comeback had him on course to challenge for more Olympic gold at Rio in 2016. The 29-year-old retired after the 2012 London Olympics with a record 22 Olympic medals, but launched a comeback earlier this year. He won three gold medals at the Pan Pacific Championships in late August in Australia to cement his place on the world championship team. Phelps said in his statement on social media on Sunday that he was entering a program ""that will provide the help I need to better understand myself."" He gave no further details of the issues he expected to deal with. Police say a breathalyzer administered after Phelps' arrest measured his blood alcohol level at .14, almost twice the legal limit of .08 in Maryland. Phelps' trial is scheduled for November 19. Ten years ago, Phelps pleaded guilty to driving while impaired in rural Maryland. He was sentenced to 18 months' probation and fined $250 for what he later described as an ""isolated incident."" He was under the microscope again in 2009 -- after his glittering eight-gold haul at the 2008 Beijing Olympics -- when a photograph of him apparently smoking a marijuana pipe was published in a British tabloid and went viral. USA Swimming banned him for three months over that incident. -Agencies","Michael Phelps, the 18-time Olympic swim champion, has been banned for six months by USA Swimming and dropped from the 2015 World Championships following his arrest for drunk driving.

If you knew Calcutta the way I know Calcutta.,"At first glance, Z’s Precinct at 18/76 Dover Lane appears to be a niche store in an elegantly raees south Kolkata neighbourhood. The kind of neighbourhood — bylane off a Y-lane off a bylane off a lane off a road — that watches its cousins across the city turn commercial and regret.I went Saturday early afternoon. I found parking space. The art deco structures appeared freshly painted. There were no cafes where drinkers alternated between caffeine and computers. There were no bikes. There were no parking attendants descending on me while I was still backing into position — Kotokkhon thakben? (how long will you stay?). There was nobody. It could have been Sunday afternoon; it could have been Covid; it could have been a bandh. Just the kind of place where no serious business person would set up a store because it lacks those three words that define footfalls the world over – ‘critical population mass’. This fleeting observation is a necessary preamble to why Z’s Precinct is the candle in the high breeze of Kolkata’s retail sector.One, I don’t see a series of warm yellow lights spot-focused on merchandise shelves; the light here is a fusion of naked bulbs and filtered sunlight. Two, there is no line of extended sight when the front door opens; one looks into a smallish room that leads into a smallish room that leads into a smallish room. How so un-store. Three, the ceiling rises beyond the standard ten feet that has become such a part of our contemporary existences that anything higher is immediately ‘felt’. Four, there is an absence of merchandise shelves; the shirts can be picked off hangers but when you need a shawl or an embroidered table spread, it has to be extracted from a cupboard.Five, the desk assigned on which I can scribble this interview is probably a century old; the chair is ‘Bawa adam ka zamaane ka’ (from the time of Adam), as mom would have said; the saris have been placed around typical circular furniture from the last century where the day’s cast-offs would have been carelessly dropped. Six, the flower-shaped back-shade assigned to the light bulb is the kind under which north-Kolkata craftsmen huddle. Seven, I find a complete absence of large format glazed tiles; the zameen is red cement (polished) and terrazzo. The only floor that is wooden was because the previous owner had put Spartek and this new rentee intoned ‘brand-destroyer’. Eight, this is an old-world environment in a new-age business: everything is neat but not picture perfect; the red cement floor on the staircase carries the fade of the decades. Why would someone set up an upmarket store in an uncommercial neighbourhood, destroying his last chance of breaking even by curating a conventional setting with no ‘glam’? Why would the interior designer (read ‘promoter’) leave everything just as it looked in the middle of the last century? Why would a store curator, with the experience of having headed the marketing function in the hospitality business of a prominent multinational conglomerate, extend the flavour of yesterday’s residential into today’s retail?Rajesh Sen, promoter-curator, presents his case. “Probably the first word that the interior designer used when this place was being designed was ‘remodel’. The designer started by saying ‘Oh, we can remodel this’ and ‘We can remodel that’. My opening brief was, ‘We will leave everything we find in its original state. We will preserve the interplay between the external architecture, internal structure and furniture, so that the visual language we speak is faithful, seamless and consistent.’ This was reinforced when I turned the suggestion down for blocking the metal ventilators high up on the walls. The designer said that blocking would protect air-conditioning effectiveness; I said that the inbuilt architectural ventilator would make the place breathe better. We had no disagreements thereafter.“We even retained the fans – outsized by today’s standard. After we had been under it for a few months we recognised its utility: the blades have a gentle curve, the wide blade sweep provides a superior sweep as opposed to modern fans that run faster, are more energy-efficient but less effective. “The fact that one sought to leave the place as it was didn’t require me to do nothing; it required one to think deeper. If one had re-modelled then one would have simply run an axe through everything. Responsible preservation took six months longer; the paint was meticulously scraped off the cupboards and that exposed the rich Burma teak. There were two chairs with complementary parts missing so we integrated the two and the result is one composite chair — the way it must have been, say, 80 years ago. The only important change was that the exposed electrical lines were internalised because we wished to create a museum. The rest is the way it largely was.“A number of people ask: Why did you not remodel? My answer: I wished to create a social museum. There will come a time when modern consumers will fatigue of the artificial; they will seek the authentic. This place is as authentic as it gets: this is how people lived. The next question: why is it relevant? My answer is that the moment the consumer enters, he or she feels relaxed that there is no salesperson watching over her shoulder, the ambience is homely, everything is at eye level and proximate, the lighting is subdued and they can make the right ‘uninfluenced’ decision. This is how consumers would like to be treated. This makes a retail store of this nature relevant. “Some time ago, a group of architects came from Edinburgh University to study the neighbourhood. After they had examined the application of our two-storeyed structure from the inside, they didn’t think they wanted to see anything else. After mapping dozens of homes and neighbourhoods, they came to the conclusion that this was perfect — the way we had retained and repurposed without remodelling.” Responsible conservation needs to factor what the business will do. Will it be compatible with the architecture? Can both co-exist? Rajesh Sen again. “Z’s Precinct is more than a retail store; it is a multi-activity centre. This has helped de-risk from a complete dependance on one line of business. The result is that at the ground level, the store retails niche one-off textile products curated from across the country. The second level is a show area that serves as a gallery for events. The third level has been allocated to a studio apartment (to be revived following the pandemic). There is a fourth line of business where one curates heritage cuisine.”“My heritage cuisine has been derived from a study of the menus of legendary fine-dining brands of the yesteryears — Maxim’s, Firpo’s, Pelitis and the 300 Club being the most prominent. I also worked with an art historian (Pritha Gupta). We accessed dozens of menus; our process was marked by trial and error until we got the taste our predecessor chefs must have got. We now curate meals only as per order. We do not preserve; we do not freeze; we do not carry forward.”By the close of the conversation, I began to get the idea: the intimate cosiness had been extended into the business model: no volume stocking, selective curation, one SKU of each design, products not available elsewhere, items personally conceived or handpicked, experimenting with what does not exist and curating the natural cum hand-made (‘breathes better, easy on the skin’). The result of this de-commoditised approach is that what one may lose out by way of volumes is more than made up by nicheness, sticker price, space saving and brand recall — ‘Kothaao paaoa jaai na’ (you don’t get it anywhere else). At Z’s Precinct, the space limitation is addressed flexibly: what is a show area one moment can be transformed into a dining area. The result is that it has more applications than one. It reaches more customer kinds. It enjoys cross-sale. Its advertising spend is zero. Is there a future for this contrarian approach? Rajesh tells me of one of his inspirations — the Koramangala (Bengaluru) home of Charles Correa. When it was sold it was expected that the new owner would say, ‘Let’s replace the floor with Kajaria’ or ‘Let us change the windows with Fenesta.’ The new owner simply said, ‘We will preserve the vision of the creator and preserve the integrity of the home’. This home is now one of the better-performing stores of FabIndia.","This article details Z's Precinct, a unique retail store in Kolkata that goes against the grain by embracing the building's original architecture and ambience. The curated collections, heritage cuisine, and multi-activity approach all contribute to a distinct experience that attracts customers through its nicheness and authenticity.",Business and Finance,2023-12-11 00:00:00
Aditya Birla Fashion to raise up to ₹800 crore for TCNS acquisition,"Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail (ABFRL) will raise ₹700-800 crore in debt to help fund the acquisition of TCNS Clothing, a top company official said. ""For funding, we probably need about ₹700 to 800 crore through external debt, which we will have to raise... The remaining ₹800 crore will be funded through internal accruals,"" Ashish Dikshit, managing director of ABFRL told ET. ""Our balance sheet is strong enough to raise that."" On Friday, ABFRL had signed an agreement to buy 51% stake in TCNS - which owns women's ethnic wear brands such as W, Elleven and Aurelia - for ₹1,650 crore. As part of the deal, ABFRL will make a conditional open offer to acquire up to 29% stake at ₹503 per share from public shareholders and acquire the remaining stake from the founder promoters to reach an overall shareholding of 51% in TCNS. Post the transaction, TCNS will be merged with ABFRL and public shareholders of TCNS will receive 11 shares of ABFRL for every six shares that they hold in TCNS. While the overall apparel market is largely unorganised, within the branded apparel space, retail share of women's wear is expected to increase to 35% by FY25 from 31% in FY20, according to a report by Antique Stock Broking. Also, international retailers such as Zara and H&M are not present in women's ethnic wear, and having strong presence in this segment provides an advantage to Indian apparel retailers in the overall category. ""It is a very fragmented market if you look at mid to lower part of the market. But in the premium side, I don't see too many brands of large size,"" Dikshit said. ""Also, we have not just got a very strong asset in terms of the brand and distribution, we also got a management team which has consistently delivered over a long period of time.""","Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail plans to raise ₹700-800 crore through external debt for acquiring 51% stake in TCNS Clothing, while the remaining ₹800 crore will come from internal accruals.

Supreme Court dismisses Teesta Setalvad’s plea to de-freeze bank accounts,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the pleas of activist Teesta Setalvad, her husband and her two NGOs challenging the Gujarat high court order rejecting their pleas for de-freezing of their personal bank accounts. A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra said the pleas are dismissed. Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand and their two NGOs—Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace—had challenged the 7 October 2015 verdict of the high court in the alleged misappropriation of funds received by their NGOs for Gujarat riot victims of 2002.The apex court had reserved its verdict on July 5 this year. Earlier the top court had questioned the source of money in the bank accounts of Setalvad and others which were frozen by the Ahmedabad Police in 2015 after the allegations of misappropriation had surfaced.One of the residents of Gulberg society, Firoz Khan Pathan, had filed a complaint against Setalvad and others alleging that money was raised to make a museum at Gulberg Society in the memory of 69 people killed in the 2002 Gujarat riots, but it had not been utilised for the purpose. The freezing of the accounts by Ahmedabad Police had come soon after its crime branch had started probing a case in which Setalvad and others were accused of embezzling Rs1.51 crore collected to convert Gulbarg Society into a museum. The high court had upheld the verdict of a lower court in this regard observing that the probe was at a serious point in the alleged case of Gulbarg society fund embezzlement.In the embezzlement case lodged by the Gujarat Police, the couple had challenged the cancellation of bail in the apex court, while in the alleged FCRA violation case, CBI has challenged the anticipatory bail granted to them by the Bombay High Court. Both matters are pending before the apex court.","The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed pleas by activist Teesta Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand, and their NGOs—Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace—seeking de-freezing of personal bank accounts.

Rabha carves out a niche in theatre,"IN the cultural tapestry of the North-East India, every major tribe has its own characteristic culture, tradition and tribal way of life by virtue of which it occupies a distinct space in the region’s colourful ethnic canvas. Rabha is one such dominant tribe which zealously sticks to its ethos while it believes in peaceful co-existence with all other communities. The Rabha tribe now has a role model in Sukracharjya Rabha (34) who has carved a niche for himself in theatre through his unique experiment with plays based on Rabha folk traditions to the global stage. Sukracharjya’s unusual theatre group Badungduppa, established in Rampur in Goalpara district of Western Assam in 1998, is gaining popularity as a new type of theatre in India and abroad. He bagged the Sangeet Natak Academy’s Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar 2009 and the Aditya Vikram Birla Kala Kiron Puraskar 2010. He speaks to The Tribune about his innovative theatre. Excerpts: Q: What does Badungduppa mean? A: It refers to a traditional musical instrument made of bamboo and leather strings. Its music, the Rabha tribe believe, stirs one’s soul and drives out evil from the human heart. My theatre group is named after it for two reasons: first, we base our plays mainly on folklore; and secondly to popularise a wonderful but forgotten folk musical instrument of the Rabha tribe. Q: Why are you attached to your native place even while pursuing your profession in the world of theatre art? A: Culturally, we are a rich nation and the North-East is a treasure trove of ethnic cultures and tradition that have remained unknown outside. We should have a stage in every village to explore and develop the traditional culture so that the world knows us better. I decided to stay put in Rampur with my community people so that we can use it as a springboard for propagating our rich folk tradition through plays. Badungduppa is our spring board. We have an open air theatre in a natural setting at Rampur where we practise regularly. We have hostels for artistes (boys and girls) and a dormitory. Q: Who has been the greatest influence in your journey? A: I was attracted to acting, drama since my childhood. I used to enjoy those ‘yatra type’ plays staged in our area. We tried to reenact those plays inside bamboo grooves in the village. These sessions gave us courage to organise stage plays in ‘Bihu’ functions in villages. At a Assam Government workshop at Kalakshetra in Guwahati in 2003, H. Kanhailal was impressed about my works and theatre group and invited me to Manipur Kalakshetra to see the production process. And thus started our guru-shishya relationship. Q: How fruitful has your journey been? A: Our unconventional way of staging plays based on folktales have now been accepted by people within and outside the state. We have participated in national and international drama festivals. We have so far staged over a dozen plays. Tikhar, Changkoy, Rupalim, Maider aru Fandi, Lovita, Madaiah muchi and To’paidom are some of our best known productions. Q: What is the highpoint in your journey so far? A: Theatre Embassy, The Netherlands, has become our partner in various projects sponsored by them. In 2008, the Badungduppa started working with the project The Power of Puppetry started by Evelien Pullens, who was sent by Theatre Embassy. In the project, young actors were trained in puppetry and visual theatre. This project ended in January 2009 with the presentation of Bijuli which toured Assam and Karnataka. Currently, Daina Martinez from Bolivia is working with us. Our annual theatre festival, Under the Sal Tree, based on a folk theme, has gained popularity. Plays in different tribal languages of the North-East are staged during the festivals participated by artistes from differest states. Our basic idea is to reach out to the people through drama, use the medium as a tool for social change and education with an objective to purge society of social evils like caste system and witch-hunting.","Sukracharjya Rabha, a prominent figure in North-East Indian theatre, has gained acclaim through his innovative group, Badungduppa. Established in 1998 in Rampur, Assam, the group integrates Rabha folk traditions into its performances, using the name Badungduppa, a traditional musical instrument, to emphasize the preservation of these traditions. Rabha’s theatre is noted for its unique approach, which blends folklore with contemporary stagecraft, gaining recognition both nationally and internationally. The group’s highpoints include collaborations with international projects like The Power of Puppetry and its popular annual festival, ""Under the Sal Tree."" Rabha’s work aims to use theatre for social change and education, addressing issues such as caste discrimination and witch-hunting. His dedication to his community and his innovative use of traditional art forms have earned him prestigious awards and recognition.",Opinion and Editorial,2011-03-20 00:00:00
‘Permit me to die’: UP woman judge to CJI,"New Delhi : Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dhananjay Y Chandrachud on Thursday sought a status report from the Allahabad high court administration on the status of an inquiry into allegations of sexual harassment raised by a woman civil judge in Uttar Pradesh’s Banda district against a district judge of the state judiciary and his associates. The development comes on a day when the woman judge’s letter to the CJI went viral on social media. In the two-page letter, the woman judge asked for the CJI’s permission to end her life following the abuse and harassment she had endured in her career during her posting in Baranski, including unsettling incidents with the district judge there.","“I have no will to live anymore. I have been rendered to a Walking Corpse in the last year and a half. There is no purpose in carrying this soulless and lifeless body around anymore. There is no purpose left in my life.

Stephen Hawking: A brief history of genius,"Stephen Hawking, who has died aged 76, was Britain's most famous modern-day scientist, a genius who dedicated his life to unlocking the secrets of the Universe. Born on January 8, 1942 — 300 years to the day after the death of the father of modern science, Galileo Galilei — he believed science was his destiny. But fate also dealt Hawking a cruel hand. Most of his life was spent in a wheelchair crippled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neurone disease that attacks the nerves controlling voluntary movement. Remarkably, Hawking defied predictions he would only live for a few years, overcoming its debilitating effects on his mobility and speech that left him paralysed and able to communicate only via a computer speech synthesiser. ""I am quite often asked: how do you feel about having ALS?"" he once wrote. ""The answer is, not a lot. ""I try to lead as normal a life as possible, and not think about my condition, or regret the things it prevents me from doing, which are not that many."" Stephen William Hawking, though, was far from normal. Inside the shell of his increasingly useless body was a razor-sharp mind, fascinated by the nature of the Universe, how it was formed and how it might end. ""My goal is simple,"" he once said. ""It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all."" Much of that work centred on bringing together relativity — the nature of space and time — and quantum theory -- how the smallest particles in the Universe behave — to explain the creation of the Universe and how it is governed. Life on Earth at risk In 1974, he became one of the youngest fellows of Britain's most prestigious scientific body, the Royal Society, at the age of 32. In 1979 he was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, where he had moved from Oxford University to study theoretical astronomy and cosmology. A previous holder of the prestigious post was the 17th-century British scientist Isaac Newton. Hawking eventually puts Newton's gravitational theories to the test in 2007 when, aged 65, he went on a weightless flight in the United States as a prelude to a hoped-for sub-orbital spaceflight. Characteristically, he did not see the trip as a mere birthday present. Instead, he said he wanted to show that disability was no bar to achievement and to encourage interest in space, where he believed humankind's destiny lay. ""I think the human race has no future if it doesn't go into space,"" he said. ""I believe life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster such as sudden global warming, nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus or other dangers."" More recently he said artificial intelligence (AI) could contribute to the eradication of disease and poverty while warning of its potential dangers. ""In short, success in creating AI could be the biggest event in the history of our civilisation. ""Alongside the benefits, AI will also bring dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many,"" Hawking said in 2016, at the opening of a new AI research centre at Cambridge University. Pop culture and politics Hawking's genius brought him global fame and he becomes known as a witty communicator dedicated to bringing science to a wider audience. His 1988 book ""A Brief History of Time"" sought to explain to non-scientists the fundamental theories of the universe and it became an international bestseller, bringing him global acclaim. It was followed in 2001 by ""The Universe in a Nutshell."" In 2007, Hawking published a children's book, ""George's Secret Key to the Universe,"" with his daughter, Lucy, seeking to explain the workings of the solar system, asteroids, his pet subject of black holes and other celestial bodies. Hawking also moved into popular culture, with cameos in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and ""The Simpsons,"" while his voice appeared in Pink Floyd songs. Beyond scientific debate Hawking also weighed into politics, describing Donald Trump as"" a demagogue who seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator"" ahead of his election as US president. Hawking also warned Britain ahead of the Brexit referendum in 2016 against leaving the European Union: ""Gone are the days when we could stand on our own against the world."" Making the most of 'every minute' Hawking first married Jane Wilde in 1965 and had three children. The couple split after 25 years and he married his former nurse, Elaine Mason, but the union broke down amid allegations, denied by him, of abuse. The love story between Hawking and Wilde was retold in the 2014 film ""The Theory of Everything,"" which won Britain's Eddie Redmayne the best actor Oscar for his portrayal of the scientist. The Oscar triumph was celebrated by Hawking, who has reportedly said there were moments watching the film when he thought he was watching himself. He was also the subject of a 2013 documentary, ""Hawking,"" in which he reflected on his life: ""Because every day could be my last, I have the desire to make the most of each and every minute.""","Stephen Hawking, who passed away at 76, was renowned as Britain's leading contemporary scientist. Afflicted by ALS, he defied expectations of a short lifespan, utilizing a computer synthesizer for communication. Hawking's quest for understanding the universe united relativity and quantum theory, investigating its origins and laws. Becoming a fellow of the Royal Society at 32, he held the prestigious Lucasian Professorship at Cambridge, continuing Isaac Newton's legacy. Hawking championed space exploration, viewing it as crucial amidst threats like global warming and AI dangers. His books, notably ""A Brief History of Time,"" made complex science accessible globally. Hawking ventured into pop culture with appearances in ""Star Trek"" and ""The Simpsons,"" and critiqued politics, condemning Donald Trump and warning against Brexit. His life and marriages, particularly depicted in ""The Theory of Everything,"" showcased his resilience and pursuit of every moment's value.",Science and Technology,2018-03-14 00:00:00
Bhaag Mikha has changed Farhan Akhtar's life,"Farhan Akhtar has earlier said, “When I take up a film, I always think of the effect it will have on my children when they see the film years later.” 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' will certainly qualify as a film that he can be proud of. As the film nears the 100-crore mark and continues to get the love from the audience and the tax-free special status given to it by several state governments, we spoke to Farhan urf Milkha about how the film has changed his life. Excerpts: How has the success of the film Bhaag Milkha Bhaag impacted your life? It has given me a lot of confidence to look out for things that will be challenging to do. It also makes a lot of writers and filmmakers not think of me as just an urban metro-centric guy and I am being offered different roles breaking the mould I was slotted in so far. When you make a film, you can never plan success, but can only hope for the best. The moment you plan it, the design will destroy it. But when it surpasses what you had planned, you feel so small in comparison. It’s a great reassurance to be true to your instinct. To me, the philosophy of Milkhaji is true that genuinely if you work hard, the results can be outstanding. We remember him as he worked harder than anyone else at that time. I feel really happy and grateful for the acceptance, given what has gone into the film and the love it has got in return. Has the response to this film been different than your earlier films Zingadi Na Milegi Dobara or Dil Chahta Hai? There is something about this movie that has resonated and touched people’s hearts for me, more than ever before. I was talking to my dad the other day that never before on any film that I have made or directed or acted in, has a film appealed to a cross-section of society like this has. From the moment I leave home, from the guy who checks your ID at the airport to the lady who checks you in to the guy who gives you the coffee at the lounge to the guy who is tearing the boarding pass at the boarding gate to the man in the suit sitting next to you in the flight to the driver who picks you up at the airport, says nice things about the film. And that is because it is a human story that has touched every strata of society. I felt really good post the release of the film on Monday, when I got a phone call from Shah Rukh (known to be Farhan’s close friend) who said, ‘I just called to say apni picture hit ho gayee.’ I was so touched. From being a complete vagabond at 17 to putting in the effort required to play Milkha, have you surprised yourself? I remember so clearly as a kid, my biggest problem in life was I used to never follow up on anything. I would get excited about doing something, but the fad would fade off within 2-3 weeks. The guy in Lakshya had a lot of me in it. While it has not happened overnight, I have come a full circle in this film. It was really tough, but the commitment to play Milkha revealed the extent to which you had to dig deep, no matter what happens to do the role. It’s a game changer for setting standards of hard work that an actor can put into a role. While in the industry we compete for the outside world, within the fraternity, I find it extremely inspirational when I see good work as you want to do something even better. It’s amazing if my work will inspire others. Did you get stuck with your will power during this journey? Fortunately, I was constantly motivated by the right people. Apart from my personal training team, Yograj Singhji's presence was really positively reassuring. While he was an actor in the film, he is also a cricket coach in real life, he pushes and nurtures you. It’s an amazing combination of pampering and torturing. It makes you give everything for that person. Your first dream was to be an actor. Somewhere in this journey, you also became a writer, director and singer. What will you do next? Currently, I am so enjoying this experience of playing these different parts and as long as I am enjoying it, I will continue to do it for sure. I am currently looking out to do a film as an actor for my company Excel Entertainment and starting my live concerts. In any case, I am not a great one to make plans for the future.","Farhan Akhtar reflects on the transformative impact of ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,"" expressing gratitude for the film's success and the diverse roles it has brought his way. He notes the film's universal appeal and how it resonated across society, surpassing the reception of his previous works. Akhtar discusses his personal growth during the film's production, emphasizing the rigorous commitment required to portray Milkha Singh. He credits supportive mentors for sustaining his willpower throughout the journey. Despite his varied talents in writing, directing, and singing, Akhtar remains open to new opportunities, focusing on enjoying the present roles and experiences without rigid future plans.",Entertainment,2013-08-05 00:00:00
China billionaire starts venture to rival Musk’s Spacex,"beijing : The Chinese owner of Volvo Cars announced it will become the country’s first private company to build satellites as billionaire Li Shufu follows Elon Musk into space. Li’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. started building a production-and-testing center in Taizhou, Zhejiang province, on Tuesday, it said in a statement. Geely plans to begin the launch of commercial low-orbit satellites by the end of the year, the Hangzhou-based company said. Li is betting his satellites will give Geely an edge in the burgeoning driverless-car industry and provide more accurate navigation systems that can pinpoint locations by the centimeter, not meters. The move also reflects the growing ambitions of one of the auto industry’s most acquisitive tycoons -- besides Volvo, Geely’s bought Lotus Cars and become the biggest shareholder of Daimler AG. “Geely must take the initiative to embrace change, develop through innovation, find new synergies online and offline, and cooperate with global partners to become a global technology leader,” Li said. bloomberg","The Chinese company Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., owned by billionaire Li Shufu, is venturing into satellite production, aiming to become the country's first private company to do so.

"Madhya Pradesh: Congress stands by demand of teachers, says Kamal Nath","BHOPAL: PCC chief Kamal Nath on Saturday said that the Congress party “totally supports” the demands of candidates who were selected as teachers but were not given appointment by the state government. Selected candidates on Saturday reached the BJP state headquarters and demanded that they be issued their appointment letters. Incidentally, the entire process of selection was completed during the erstwhile Congress regime. But the Nath-led government was toppled on March 20, 2020 and the appointment letters could not be issued. “It is unfortunate that even after the completion of all phases for selection of teachers, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government has not issued an order for their appointments. While endlessly waiting for their appointments, these selected candidates today are facing a lot of hardships in life along with their families,” the former chief minister tweeted. “On the auspicious day of Guru Purnima, they are sacrificing their hair and holding demonstrations demanding their appointments. This is an embarrassment for all of us. The Congress party is with these selected candidates and fully supports their demand,” Nath said.

Restrictions to contain the novel coronavirus shuttered stores across the world and piled pressure on fashion giants such as H&M and its main rival and world leader, Zara owner Inditex.H&M, which in April flagged it expected a second quarter loss, said on Friday it had increased price cuts that squeezed margins, and warned of further markdowns.It reported a pre-tax loss of 6.5 billion crowns (£559.4 million) against a year-earlier profit of 5.9 billion.

This is so crazy…’: Google makes fun of ‘new’ iOS 26 features for iPhones,"Google has poked fun at Apple’s new iOS 26 features, claiming Pixel phones introduced them years ago in a playful ad campaign. Apple’s latest iOS 26 has not only drawn attention but has sparked a wave of reactions across the tech industry, with competitors stepping up their responses in unexpected ways. The announcement of the ""Liquid Glass"" design triggered a wave of responses, notably from Samsung and Microsoft. Now, Google has joined the conversation with a light-hearted ad that playfully challenges Apple’s latest software update. The ad features an exchange between the Google Pixel 9 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro, where Pixel questions the originality of some iOS 26 features by pointing out that these functionalities have existed on Pixel phones for years. Google humorously highlighted how many iOS 26 features already exist on Pixel phones in its latest ad.(Google) Google humorously highlighted how many iOS 26 features already exist on Pixel phones in its latest ad.(Google) Google’s Playful Take on iOS 26 Features In the ad, the iPhone persona excitedly lists features such as live translation for text messages, Hold Assist, and call screening. The Pixel responds by noting it introduced live translation four years ago, Hold Assist five years ago, and call screening seven years ago. This back-and-forth forms part of Google’s ongoing ""#BestPhonesForever"" campaign, which highlights how several features in iOS 26 seem to have drawn inspiration from features long present on Google Pixel devices.

Women on corporate boards: A way forward,"The provision of having one woman independent director (WID) on a corporate board has worked well over the last ten years. It should now be increased to a requirement of minimum of two WIDs. Working woman(Shutterstock) The Companies Act of 2013 had a unique provision related to board of directors. It mandated that the board of directors of a large company must have a woman director. Initially, in family-owned companies this requirement was met by inducting a woman family member on the board. This provision was then amended that boards must have a WID. This provision has been in force for ten years. So, it would be timely to review how well this provision has worked, the lessons learnt and the way forward. To explore this, we interviewed over 40 directors, both men and women. Most of the men directors had served on boards without any women directors before 2014 and observed the impact of having WIDs. The statistical results of this provision are encouraging. The women on corporate boards has increased from 4.5% in 2014 to nearly 20% in 2024. Some companies already have two, three or more WIDs. But most companies have interpreted this provision of requiring a minimum of one WID to having a maximum of one WID and are stuck at one WID on their board. In our interviews with board members, we posed the following questions: Let’s say there are two boards: Company A and Company B. All board members in both companies are experienced and capable professionals with backgrounds in business, law, accounting, technology, banking and government. However, Company A has all men directors and Company B has seven men and three WIDs. The question is: Is Company A or Company B more likely to serve its shareholders, customers, employees and society better in the long-term. All interviewees emphatically said company B. Why? Because women bring a slightly different perspective to discussions in the boardroom because of their own life experiences and instinct. They are not always kinder and gentler but often present a different point of view. Even men directors feel that this gender diversity avoids group think and results in better board decisions. Has provision of having a WID improved corporate governance? Most felt that many provisions of the 2013 Act have significantly improved corporate governance. Having a WID is one of those provisions, but there are other important provisions, such as role of independent directors, which have helped upgrade corporate governance. Most women board members, we interviewed, felt that journey of WIDs on boards has had its challenges. Accepting WIDs as equal colleagues by some men board members took time. More significantly, many WIDs themselves started with self-doubt and internal challenge. Do I deserve to be here or is it only because of the regulation, they wondered? Most women in professional careers, in the past, have had to act like their male colleagues to compete and succeed. But in boards, their instincts and points of view women are valuable and valued. So, this transition to naturally expressing themselves as women in a board setting took time and adjustment. WIDs change their minds when provided with additional information. Their men colleagues at times are slow to do so. WIDs have better insights in consumer products, health care, retail financial services, education, customer care, and women employees’ issues. Already WIDs are playing a very significant role in in nomination and remuneration committees (NRCs) corporate social responsibility committees. WIDs generally are more risk averse in mergers and acquisitions, excessive loans, and rapid overseas expansion. An important question which was raised was that of should the ratio of WIDs be increased to 33% and should women be in more important positions such as board chairs and chairs of audit committees and NRCs. Most felt it should be done voluntarily and gradually. However, all felt that regulation should now be amended to require two WIDs. Gender balance in senior management is a serious problem. Despite board having 20% WIDs, the number of women at senior and middle management companies is very low, around 5%. The fact is that the culture in many companies, particularly at middle and lower levels, is unequal towards women largely reflecting attitudes with in our society. At junior or factory level, in some cases women don’t enjoy equal opportunities and pay, dignity, respect and at times safe work environment. Should WIDs do more and devote more time on these issues than their men colleagues on the boards. Should WIDs be visible to companies’ women managers and employees as beacons, as lifting up glass elevators and as role models. Should they work with management to improve the gender balance? Should they act as mentors to develop women in senior and top management? Should they visit factories more often to better understand women’s working conditions and review all POSH investigation results. For these additional responsibilities, should they be paid more than their male colleagues? Most interviewees felt that WIDs should do some or all of these additional activities. Some felt that board chairman and other men directors should also get more involved in these responsibilities. However, interestingly, most felt that WIDs should not be paid more than their men colleagues for these additional responsibilities. Over all, it appears Companies Act 2014 provision of mandating one WID has achieved its objective. But more needs to be done.

A pioneer in widow remarriage and eradication of untouchability,"Rev. John Baptiste Trincal, a French Jesuit, secretly presided over marriage between a widow and a youth in the Vellala community in Tiruchi. His character is portrayed in the Tamil biographical novel Munnathi, penned by Fr. Mark StephenAn incident that took place in 1844 shook Tiruchi. Though widow remarriage was common among some sections of the intermediate communities and Dalits, it was an anathema to Brahmins and other caste Hindus, including Vellalas. Rev. John Baptiste Trincal, a French Jesuit, temporarily in charge of St. Mary’s Church, secretly presided over the marriage between a widow and a youth in the Vellala community. This paved the way for remarriage and rehabilitation of widows. Trincal himself was taken aback when the youth approached him with a request since widow remarriage was not prevalent among the caste Hindus. He realised that Christianity too could not bring about a change among those who have converted to the new faith. It was a question of who will bell the cat? “Why should I not bell the cat? An enthusiasm engulfed Trincal. God has given an opportunity to bless such a marriage,” thought Trincal, the real-life character as portrayed in the Tamil biographical novel Munnathi, penned by Fr. Mark Stephen.","In 1844, Rev. John Baptiste Trincal, a French Jesuit in Tiruchi, shocked the community by secretly officiating the marriage between a widow and a youth in the Vellala community.

Global Trust Bank to be merged with OBC,"The troubled Global Trust Bank (GTB) will be merged with the Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced on Monday. The decision follows hectic activity in the corridors of the Ministry of Finance in the Capital to save the bank following negative reserves, sources here said. The RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India would oversee the merger so that it is completed quickly, RBI executive director Usha Thorat said in a statement here. “Whatever action has been initiated is for the protection of the depositors' interest,” she told reporters here. Details of the merger are being worked out and would be put out for public scrutiny till August 7. There will be no swap arrangement for the GTB shareholders when the private sector bank is amalgamated with the Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), according to reports. The OBC said it had made the offer to merge GTB with itself as it perceived synergy between the two banks. The OBC gets customers from the GTB and its branches, many of whom are based in south India where the state-run bank has a limited presence. The two banks also share a common technology platform. “There is a terrible amount of synergy between the two banks. We are a north-based bank and they are a south-based one. We should be able to clean up the books in a very short time,” Oriental Managing Director B.D. Narang told reporters. The Centre had on July 24 placed the crisis-ridden Secunderabad-based GTB under moratorium for a three-month period till October 23, partially freezing its operations following ‘wrong’ financial disclosures. The moratorium imposed by the RBI on the GTB would definitely stay in force until August 7, Ms Thorat told reporters. Depositors may withdraw more with RBI approval for emergencies, such as medical and education costs. “There was no limit on such withdrawals but in the previous moratorium cases, the RBI allowed up to Rs 1 lakh to be taken out,” Ms Thorat said.","In a bid to protect depositors' interests, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announces the merger of the troubled Global Trust Bank (GTB) with the Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC).

"Indian crude oil basket touches 10-year high, petrol price unchanged","The basket of crude oil that India buys has hit a decade high of $121 per barrel, but retail selling prices of petrol and diesel continue to remain frozen. The Indian basket on June 9 touched $121.28, matching levels seen in February/March 2012, according to data available from the oil ministry's Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC). As per the PPAC, the Indian basket of crude oil averaged $111.86 per barrel between February 25 and March 29 — the immediate period after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil on fire. It averaged $103.44 a barrel between March 30 and April 27. 13-week high for international prices International oil prices held near a 13-week high on Thursday, underpinned by robust demand from key buyers like the US. They, however, pared some gains on Friday, with Brent crude futures for August losing 81 cents to trade at $122.26 per barrel. US West Texas Intermediate crude for July was at $120.72 a barrel, down 79 cents. Retail fuel rates, however, continue to be on a freeze in India. State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) are supposed to adjust petrol and diesel prices daily in line with the cost, but they have been since November 2021 moderating pump rates. India dependent on imports India is 85% dependent on imports to meet its oil needs and so local pump rates are benchmarked against international prices. Industry sources said local pump rates are benchmarked to around $85 per barrel crude oil price but oil firms haven't changed rates as they aid the government in trying to control inflation, which already is ruling at an almost eight-year high of 7.8%. Effect on inflation Fuel prices, particularly diesel, have a cascading effect on inflation as an elevated price will lead to higher transportation costs, spiking prices across the board, including essentials like vegetables. The sources said the industry was selling petrol at a loss of about ₹18 per litre and diesel at ₹21 a litre. Petrol and diesel prices were last revised to align with the cost on April 6 and have been on freeze since then. Last month, rates were reduced after the government cut excise duty on petrol by ₹8 per litre and that on diesel by ₹6. Last week, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri stated that oil companies are responsible corporate citizens and that the government wasn't dictating retail selling prices. Despite a surge in oil prices, the three state fuel retailers first froze petrol and diesel rates for a record 137 days beginning in early November 2021 when five states, including Uttar Pradesh, went to the polls and then went into a hiatus again in April that is now 65 days old. While state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) have maintained retail operations despite losses, private sector retailers like Reliance-BP and Nayara Energy have curtailed operations to cut losses. In some places, Nayara is selling fuel at rates that are ₹3 a litre higher than public sector competition. Petrol in Delhi, currently, costs ₹96.72 a litre and diesel is priced at ₹89.62.","The price of crude oil India imports has reached a decade high of $121 per barrel, but fuel prices in India remain unchanged. This is because state-owned fuel retailers are absorbing the cost increase to avoid adding to inflation, which is already high. India relies on imports for 85% of its oil needs, so pump prices are normally linked to global prices. However, retailers haven't adjusted prices since November 2021 to help control inflation. This is despite them selling petrol at a loss of ₹18 per litre and diesel at ₹21 per litre. This price freeze is not unprecedented. In 2021, retailers paused price adjustments for 137 days during state elections. The current freeze has been in place for 65 days. Private fuel retailers are not able to absorb the losses as much and have reduced operations in some areas. They are selling fuel at slightly higher prices than state-owned retailers.",National News,2022-06-10 00:00:00

The CCPA will be empowered to conduct investigations into violations of consumer rights and institute complaints/prosecution, order recall of unsafe goods and services, order discontinuance of unfair trade practices and misleading advertisements, impose penalties on manufacturers/endorsers/publishers of misleading advertisements, he said. Paswan also said that the rules for prevention of unfair trade practice by e-commerce platforms will also be covered under this Act. The gazette notification for establishment of the Central Consumer Protection Authority and rules for prevention of unfair trade practice in e-commerce are under publication. The minister said under this Act every e-commerce entity is required to provide information relating to return, refund, exchange, warranty and guarantee, delivery and shipment, modes of payment, grievance redressal mechanism, payment methods, security of payment methods, charge-back options, etc, including country of origin which are necessary for enabling the consumer to make an informed decision at the pre-purchase stage on its platform. Paswan said that e-commerce platforms have to acknowledge the receipt of any consumer complaint within 48 hours and redress the complaint within one month from the date of receipt under this Act. He added that the New Act introduces the concept of product liability and brings within its scope, the product manufacturer, product service provider and product seller, for any claim for compensation. The minister also said that the new Act provides for simplifying the consumer dispute adjudication process in the consumer commissions, which include, among others, empowerment of the State and District Commissions to review their own orders, enabling a consumer to file complaints electronically and file complaints in consumer commissions that have jurisdiction over the place of his residence, video conferencing for hearing and deemed admissibility of complaints if the question of admissibility is not decided within the specified period of 21 days. An Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism of Mediation has been provided in the new Act, Paswan said, adding this will simplify the adjudication process. The minister said a complaint will be referred by a Consumer Commission for mediation, wherever scope for early settlement exists and parties agree for it. Mediation will be held in the Mediation Cells to be established under the aegis of the Consumer Commissions. There will be no appeal against settlement through mediation, he added. As per the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission Rules, there will be no fee for filing cases up to Rs 5 lakh, he said. He also said that there are provisions for filing complaints electronically, credit of amount due to unidentifiable consumers to Consumer Welfare Fund (CWF). The State Commissions will furnish information to Central Government on a quarterly basis on vacancies, disposal, pendency of cases and other matters, he added. Paswan further said that the New Act also introduces the concept of product liability and brings within its scope, the product manufacturer, product service provider and product seller, for any claim for compensation. The Act provides for punishment by a competent court for manufacture or sale of adulterant/spurious goods. The court may, in case of first conviction, suspend any licence issued to the person for a period of up to two years, and in case of second or subsequent conviction, cancel the licence, he said. Under this new Act, besides general rules, there are Central Consumer Protection Council Rules,Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission Rules, Appointment of President & Members in State/District Commission Rules, Mediation Rules, Model Rules and E-Commerce Rules and Consumer Commission Procedure Regulations, Mediation Regulations and Administrative control over State Commission & District Commission Regulations, Paswan said. The minister said that the Central Consumer Protection Council Rules are provided for constitution of the Central Consumer Protection Council, an advisory body on consumer issues, headed by the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution with the Minister of State as Vice Chairperson and 34 other members from different fields. The Council, which has a three-year tenure, will have minister-in-charge of consumer affairs from two states from each region- North, South, East, West, and NER. There is also provision for having working groups from among the members for specific tasks. Paswan said that in the earlier Consumer Protection Act, 1986, a single point access to justice was given, which is also time consuming. The new Act has been introduced after many amendments to provide protection to buyers not only from traditional sellers but also from the new e-commerce retailers/platforms. This Act will prove a significant tool in protecting consumer rights in the country, he added.","The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 came into effect on July 20, 2020, aiming to empower consumers and safeguard their rights through various provisions such as Consumer Protection Councils, Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions, and Product Liability. Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan highlighted the Act's significance, emphasizing the establishment of the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) to enforce consumer rights. Under the Act, the CCPA has the authority to investigate violations, recall unsafe goods, and penalize misleading advertisements. E-commerce platforms will also be regulated, requiring them to provide essential information to consumers and address complaints promptly. Additionally, the Act introduces product liability, holds manufacturers accountable for compensation claims, and simplifies the dispute resolution process through mediation. Paswan outlined key features such as fee waivers for cases up to Rs 5 lakh, electronic filing of complaints, and the establishment of Mediation Cells. The Act also addresses the sale of adulterated goods, prescribing punishments for offenders. Furthermore, various rules and regulations have been introduced to support the Act's implementation, including those for the Central Consumer Protection Council, Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions, and E-Commerce. Paswan emphasized the Act's role in protecting consumer rights in both traditional and online markets, streamlining access to justice and enhancing consumer confidence in the country.",Business and Finance,2020-07-21 00:00:00
Bottlenecks for access to Headley cleared New investigation team to be sent to US,"The Centre will form a new probe team that will get access to Laskhar-e-Toiba (LeT) operative David Coleman Headley and probe his role in Mumbai attacks. “All bottlenecks (for access to Headley) have been removed and we have a way forward. So it’s up to us to operationalise the plan forward,” said Solicitor General Gopal Subramanium, who returned from the US after holding discussions in this regard. On being asked as to how early India could get access to Headley, the country’s top law officer said: “Once we are ready to constitute our team, and get off board from India, the access should be possible.” He appreciated the “unstinted cooperation” from the US authorities and said he had a “very fruitful” round of discussions with them. Subramanium’s five-day visit was primarily aimed at understanding the US legal system within which India could get access to Headley, a Pakistani-American national, sources said. India wants to question Headley in a manner that his statement would be acceptable in a court of law here. In this regard, a chargesheet would also be required to be filed against Headley in India. Headley, who was arrested in October last, has entered into a plea bargain with the US government wherein he has offered to be available to foreign investigators through deposition, video conferencing or letters rogatory. Subramanium had earlier advised the government to settle for nothing less than Headley’s extradition to ensure his thorough custodial interrogation. Headley has told his America interrogators that he had conducted recce for the Mumbai attacks. He has also revealed that a serving Pakistani Army Major had given training to him in Pakistan. Yesterday Union Home Secretary GK Pillai while presenting the monthly report of the Home Ministry had said that Indian investigators would be given direct access to Headley.

China to begin construction of railway close to India’s border,"BEIJING, Nov 1: China is all set to begin the construction of the strategic Sichuan-Tibet railway between Ya’an in southwest Sichuan province and Linzhi in Tibet, close to the Indian border in Arunachal, the official media reported. China Railway announced on Saturday the bidding results for the construction of two tunnels and one bridge, as well as the power supply project for the Ya’an-Linzhi section of the Sichuan-Tibet railway, indicating that construction of the project is about to begin. The Sichuan-Tibet railway is the second such project in Tibet after the Qinghai-Tibet railway. It will go through the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, one of the world’s most geologically active areas, a report by the state-run China News reported. The Sichuan-Tibet railway starts from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, and travels through Ya’an and enters Tibet via Qamdo, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Lhasa from 48 hours to 13 hours, the report said. Linzhi, which is also known as Nyingchi, is located close to Arunachal border. China claims Arunachal as part of southern Tibet while India contests it. Linzhi also has an airport, one of the five built by China in the Himalayan region. The newly-built Ya’an-Linzhi section runs 1,011 kilometres and includes 26 stations. Trains are expected to run at speeds between 120 and 200 kms per hour, a staffer in charge of the project said. The total cost of the entire Sichuan-Tibet railway project is around 319.8 billion yuan (USD 47.8 billion), Global Times reported.

Afternoon naps may improve your health,"Napping in the afternoons may be more helpful than you think. New research suggests adults should indulge in hour-long afternoon naps for the sake of their health. Scientists studied almost 400 people with high blood pressure and adjusted for factors like Body Mass Index (BMI), salt intake, alcohol consumption, coffee, and whether they smoke. They found patients who took naps of at least an hour had significant health improvements over those who stayed awake the entire day. They also discovered longer naps were better than short ones. The health benefits of taking a nap included lower blood pressure, decreased risk of a heart attack or a stroke and fewer medications required. Besides that, adults who took naps at least 30 to 40 minutes long were more alert and performed better during skills tests and were found to be happier. Greek cardiologist and researcher Dr Manolis Kallistratos, said that while afternoon naps were good, hectic lifestyles didn’t allow it which was an unhealthy trait.","New research suggests that hour-long afternoon naps can significantly improve health.

Solar energy needs bigger breakthrough,"SHARE TT TT 0 India can easily become a world leader in solar energy. Our current solar power installed capacity is around 3 GW, which is 0.5% of the estimated potential. In a big push to encourage energy efficient measures, especially rooftop solar power generation, India’s first rooftop solar plant on a carport at a commercial mall ‘Unity One’ in Rohini was inaugurated recently. Tata Power Delhi Distribution and Tata Power Solar have jointly executed the 300 KW plant. This first of its kind plant which is expected to generate 4,20,000 units of green energy annually will empower the complex’s day-to-day operations meeting 80 per cent of its electricity demand, while reducing the carbon footprint of around 438 metric tonnes (MT) every year. The plant will help ‘Unity Mall’ save of Rs 50 lakh annually on electricity bill and Rs 12 crore over the entire plant life. The initiative is in line with climate change agenda for Delhi and the ‘National Solar Mission’ and is set up as part of ‘National Action Plan on Climate Change’ (NAPCC). The grid-connected, rooftop-based PV power plants supervised by Tata Power-DDl have a life span of 25 years, wherein 1KW of PV power plant will generate up to 1,400 units in a year. Consumers and institutions can also sell the surplus power generated to the Discom and attain breakeven on investment in five years. This initiative though commendable still pales in front of the tremendous progress made by solar energy in many parts of the world and for that matter in many other cities of India as well. The National Solar Mission, which aims to establish India as a global leader in solar energy, has a long way to go before the objective is achieved. India is in a unique position to extract the full advantage of alternative sources of energy such as solar power. Given the huge population and the consequent pressure on natural resources, particularly energy-India can set new milestones in the manner in which solar energy can be innovatively and thoroughly be used to cater to the burgeoning energy demand. India’s current solar power installed capacity is around 3 GW, which is 0.5% of the estimated potential. Naturally there exists a massive opportunity to tap this potential and with the right policies in place backed by efficient implementation, India can easily become a world leader in solar energy. This solar endeavor could also help address acute power shortages and make a real difference in slowing the pace of climate change. A green energy revolution is needed in India that can increase prosperity for millions of poor families by harnessing the abundant and clean energy of the sun and since being elected in May 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has strived to achieve the same by aiming to increasing India's renewable energy capacity five-fold from 30 gigawatts to 175 gigawatts, including a boost in solar power generation from 20 GW to 100 GW. The plan is to achieve these targets by 2022. India's ambitious solar energy plans can only see the light of the day if they are backed by a national energy policy, regulatory programs and innovative financing mechanisms that encourage the development of distributed energy, particularly applications that combine solar generation with efficient energy storage solutions. As a first step towards this, India must invite solar energy experts and developers so that the revised targets of 100 GW of solar and 75 MW of wind by 2022 and beyond are successfully met. Additionally, the government must expedite renewable energy powered public transportation, the current pace of initiatives are simply not enough to get a breakthrough needed. The use of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, and deployment of solar-powered EV charging stations around the country need to be stepped up. Moreover, development and implementation of ""time-of-day"" pricing must be applied which will encourage charging of vehicles at night and other times when peak demand is low. These measures coupled with zero-emission battery-powered electric buses in all major cities will not only reduce air pollution but also help reverse climate change. The government must also focus on providing innovative financing solutions such as tax-free solar bonds or green infrastructure bonds to accelerate the access to credit at globally competitive rates. This will instill more confidence from potential investors and decrease the cost of financing for renewable energy projects. Similarly, large-scale ""Solar Manufacturing Hubs"" also need to be developed in India to facilitate mass production of solar energy equipment at competitive costs. Thanks to the drive shown by the present government, India is standing on the threshold of a green energy revolution that can light up a new era of energy, economic and environmental security. But to achieve this goal India needs a breakthrough in how it produces, distributes and consumes energy. If India gets this right, the dependence on fossil fuels can be ended besides creating millions of new jobs.","India's first rooftop solar plant on a carport at a commercial mall was inaugurated by Tata Power Delhi Distribution and Tata Power Solar.

This vaccine auto debunks myths and helps book slots,"Sliding through the streets of Chennai, artist Gowtham’s auto has more to it than meets the eye. The white-blue three-wheeler, which has vials and injections popping off it, is an artistic tool to spread vaccine awareness in the city.Organised in collaboration with the Greater Chennai Corporation, the auto which is dubbed the ‘vaccine auto’, debunks vaccine myths, helps senior citizens book slots, and assuages doubters, among other things.Gowtham, who was also behind the viral corona helmet of 2020, adds that he wanted to spread the message to the nooks and crannies of the city through a creative lens.“There is still a lot of doubt and questions regarding the virus. And there is also a kind of fear among most. Through this auto, we try to reach the people on the streets who have vaccine hesitancy,” Gowtham begins.As the auto zooms through the 15 zones of Chennai, it is accompanied by a speaker blasting a pre-recorded message about vaccines and its efficiency. Driven by driver Mani, the auto also has a volunteer, who steps out of the vehicle at times to clear doubts through pamphlets and interactions.What are some of the most common questions they get? “A lot of people want to know how to register on the CoWin app. We either help them with it, or redirect them to the nearest Primary Healthcare Centre. A lot of people also enquire about the interval between two doses. We also get a lot of ‘injection podanuma’ ,” adds Gowtham, with a smile.Fear is a main barrier, and the idea is to turn that fear on its head with a creative message, Gowtham adds. “When people get a visual confirmation of the same in the form of an art piece like this on moving wheels, it makes it easier to get through to them. Vaccines are a necessity today and we wanted to do this with a twist,” the artist explains.And that is not all. The vehicle is further made of plastic waste. The vaccine vial atop the auto, for instance, is an old water can. The injections are nothing but discarded pipes. “We also used waste plywood, water bottles and other forms of plastic to complete the design in about ten days,” Gowtham reveals, adding that it was a tightrope to strike a balance between aesthetics and information with the design. And nothing better than an auto to clinch the deal. “The auto is a flavour of Chennai. What better way to drive home such a message,” he signs off.","Artist Gowtham has transformed his auto into a 'vaccine auto' in Chennai, collaborating with the city's corporation to spread vaccine awareness. The three-wheeler features vials and injections, debunking myths and helping with vaccine bookings. An accompanying speaker blasts information about vaccines as the auto travels through the city's zones. The project aims to address hesitancy and fear surrounding vaccination, with a focus on practical information like CoWin registration and dose intervals.

Let there be light,"Diwali spans a five-day celebration, commencing from Dhanteras and culminating with Bhai Dooj. The festivities vary across the diverse regions of India, with unique customs and traditions observed. NT BUZZ highlights the multitude of ways Diwali is joyously observed KALYANI JHA | NT BUZZ Diwali, also known as Deepawali, unfolds its splendour 20 days after Dussehra, igniting a nationwide celebration marked by unwavering fervour and joy. Beyond the glitz of markets adorned with lanterns, ‘akash kandil’, and idols of Lakshmi and Ganesh, Diwali transcends regional distinctions to weave a rich tapestry of diverse celebrations. ‘Diwali Ki Safai’ The famous phrase ‘Diwali Ki Safai’, akin to a deep cleaning, takes centre stage as households and shops embark on a thorough cleansing spree. This is done to prepare for the arrival of the Goddess of Wealth and Well-being, Lakshmi. This annual ritual involves meticulous cleaning, painting, and decorating with lights and earthen lamps, symbolising the welcoming of prosperity and auspiciousness. Dhanteras: A prelude to radiance Two days before Diwali, the festivities kick off with Dhanteras, a day considered auspicious for buying gold or silver. Beyond material wealth, it symbolises a celebration of cleanliness, with people investing in brooms, associated with Goddess Lakshmi. Simultaneously, those in the medical profession honour Lord Dhanvantari, the physician of the gods and the father of ayurveda. Choti Diwali: Vanquishing darkness Choti Diwali, also known as Narak Chaturdashi, commemorates the defeat of the demon Narak by Lord Krishna. In certain regions, the fierce Goddess Kali is worshipped on this day, as she is believed to have slain this demon. Lighting an earthen lamp for Yama (the God of death) symbolises a prayer for the longevity of family members. Goddess Lakshmi and the quiescent Vishnu Contrary to common belief, during Diwali, Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped alongside Ganesha, not Vishnu, as Vishnu is said to be in a state of slumber. The significance of lighting numerous diyas during this period is rooted in the darkening days of the year, symbolising the triumph of light over darkness. A continuation of joy Following the luminous spectacle of Diwali, various regions in northern India usher in additional festivities. Bhaiyyadooj sees sisters praying for the well-being of their brothers, while Annakut or Goverdhan Puja involves offering 56 preparations to express gratitude for the lifting the Govardhan mountain.

The Kayasth community celebrates Chitragupta Puja, venerating the pen and ink that meticulously record people’s lives and deeds. As the echoes of Diwali begin to faint, the celebrations continue to weave a bond of cultural richness, blending tradition, spirituality, and communal joy into the vibrant mosaic of India’s festival of lights.","Diwali spans five days, from Dhanteras to Bhai Dooj, celebrated across India with unique rituals. 'Diwali Ki Safai' initiates deep cleaning to welcome prosperity. Dhanteras signifies wealth, Choti Diwali vanquishes darkness, and Diwali worships Lakshmi.

"Tatas, Aircel only takers for MTNL 3G airwaves","NEW DELHI: Tata Teleservices and Aircel are poised to bag third-generation spectrum in the lucrative Delhi and Mumbai metros as they are the only bidders for MTNL’s offer to share its 3G network with two firms that pay the highest price. Aircel had won 3G airwaves in 13 circles and Tata Teleservices in nine when these frequencies were auctioned last year, but both these companies had failed to bag spectrum in Delhi and Mumbai. They had lost out to the country’s three largest mobile phone companies by both revenues and customers—Bharti Airtel, Reliance Communications and Vodafone Essar—in these metro cities, which are estimated to account for a fifth of the mobile industry’s revenues. MTNL had set `1,400 crore as the base price per operator when inviting bids from other telecom service providers to use its 3G frequencies, which enable services such as video calling and high-speed internet on phones. The state-owned operator will make a minimum of `2,800 crore from this deal. “The financial bids of both Tata Teleservices and Aircel will be opened in January—it is possible that the bid amount may be comparatively higher than the base price,” a top MTNL executive with direct knowledge of the development told ET. “There is also a revenue-share component—this depends on the type of 3G service offered—for instance, there are different slabs for voice and video calls, high-speed internet and other data services,” this executive added. Both Tata Teleservices and Aircel declined to comment, but a top executive from one of these companies confirmed that they were the only mobile phone companies to have submitted bids to MTNL. Talks on for roaming alliances All the six private players that won 3G airwaves are in talks with each other for strategic roaming alliances to offer these high-end services across the country. Such alliances have been made necessary since no player had won pan-India 3G airwaves during the auctions. So far, only two private operators—Reliance Communications and Tata Teleservices—have launched 3G services. The deal also involves the winners sharing 3G airwaves outside these metro cities with MTNL when the latter’s customers are on roaming. Between Aircel and Tata Teleservices, the duo jointly has 3G airwaves in all circles except Himachal Pradesh. Put simply, the deal will also enable MTNL to offer third-generation services on a pan-India level, except in Himachal Pradesh, for which it is in talks with BSNL.","Tata Teleservices and Aircel are set to acquire 3G spectrum in Delhi and Mumbai from MTNL, being the sole bidders to share its network. With base prices of ₹1,400 crore per operator, MTNL expects at least ₹2,800 crore. Talks for strategic alliances among winners aim to offer nationwide 3G services.",Technology and Gadgets,2011-01-01 00:00:00

Maharashtra seeks Rs 710.96 Cr. in lottery tax dues from Arunachal,"The Maharashtra government has written a letter to Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Mizoram for recovery of pending lottery tax worth nearly Rs 933 crore. Arunachal Pradesh owes Rs 710.96 crore, Sikkim Rs 220.04 crore and Mizoram Rs 1.7 crore (total Rs 932.7 crore) to the Maharashtra government, according to the letter. The letter from the Maharashtra finance department, dated 3 January, has been addressed to the chief secretaries of the three states. The government has said it will explore legal remedies if Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Mizoram fail to pay the dues. The letter said as per provisions of the Maharashtra Tax on Lotteries Act 2006, liability of payment of tax lies with the promoter. ‘Promoter is defined as government of any state or Union Territory or any country organising, conducting or promoting a lottery (in Maharashtra) and includes any person appointed as first importer for making lottery tickets in the state of Maharashtra by such government or country,’ it said. The promoter is liable to pay the lottery tax and the state government which is organising the lottery comes within the scope of definition of ‘promoter’, it said. “Hence, assessment order and demand notice have been sent to the respective states,” an official in the finance department said. If the tax is not paid at the earliest, the Maharashtra government will have no option but to take recourse to legal remedies, he said. The official said the three states have informed Maharashtra that they had deputed private companies to conduct the lottery. But Maharashtra is not a party to the agreement made by the three governments with their marketing agents to operate and market their state lottery tickets, he said. “The Maharashtra government did not give any consent to the agreements made by the three states with their marketing agents. “Hence, the terms and conditions of their agreements are not binding on the Maharashtra government,” the official said.

Must - have apps to track and tackle Air Pollution in these smoggy times,"Think Delhi is bad with air pollution? Well, you’re not wrong, it certainly is. But chances are the air around you isn’t very great either, whether you’re inside or outside the most polluted city in the world right now. Here are five handy apps to have on your phone to understand the air pollution around you and get tips to tackle it. 1. AirVisual AirVisual shows you a visual representation of the area around you with pollution indexes at regular intervals of distances to let you know variations in air quality even in close-by neighbourhoods. With an easy-to-use interface, this app provides more localised information rather than a generic status for a whole city. There is also a comparison tab where you can see the most polluted cities in the world and sulk if you see your own city up there. You can even add a panel in your phone’s notification bar to constantly keep you updated on changing pollution levels. 2. BreezoMeter BreezoMeter is an easy to use all-in-one app that gives you simple real-time information about the air quality around you in a graphic format. You can also open the map view to view a thermal-like map view to see the variation of air quality in your city or region. A pro version also gives you the ability to add ‘family members’, who also need to be on the app, so you can track how much your whole family is affected by pollution irrespective of where they are. 3. Plume Plume gives you a time-based forecast of the air pollution in your city. While you get a generalised number for the whole city, which isn’t very accurate to the exact location you are in, you do get a forecast dial which you can spin and see whether updates for every minute of the day, along with adjacent days. The app also has a World Air Pollution map where you can see graphical representations of pollution throughout the globe, with various pollution levels marked in different colours. An added perk is the app lets you take pictures with real-time pollution based filers and share them on your social media handles like Instagram. 4. Sameer While other apps are about measuring and keeping track of the air quality around you, Sameer, by the Central Pollution Control Board is what you’d use to take action against pollution. The app allows you to lodge complaints in areas with pollution issues and attach pictures along with text too. While the app itself is a little slow and requires patience to operate, the interface here is easy to understand. You can post and track complaints, and also see what pollution complaints other users have put up in your locality. Additionally, the app also offers an Air Quality index which can be checked for various cities and areas in either a listed or a map view. 5. Air Pollution: Delhi vs World This app specifically targeted at residents of India’s capital city Delhi is an informative awareness creation effort to make citizens aware of where Delhi stands compared to some of the other big cities of the world. There is just one main page of the interface that lists Delhi on the left and other cities on the right and showcases the various air quality stats in real time. There are also simple panels with a general information page about air pollution straight from the developer.",Here are five handy apps to have on your phone to understand the air pollution around you and get tips to tackle it.,Health and Wellness,2019-11-05 00:00:00

School Education dept set to take action against 30 teachers on strike,"School Education department in the State capital has initiated action against 30 school teachers on strike for failing to join duty on Thursday after a warning was served to them on the previous day. District Education Officer (DEO) CM Upadhyay informed that the department has sent the suspension letters of the teachers to Collector Nikunj Shrivastava for approval. A delegation of teachers belonging to the Adhyapak Samvida Shishak Sanyukta Morcha met the Collector here and expressed its opposition to the administration’s move of taking action against only a few teachers. Secretary of the teacher’s joint front Upendra Kaushal said, “We are against this move of the administration to take action against only a handful of teachers when we all are united in our struggle. Such move is definitely aimed at weakening the unity of the teachers.” Meanwhile, the strike by different cadres of government schools teachers including adhyapakas, contract teachers and gurujis continued for the forth consecutive day across the state. Notably, following its announcement in January this year, the State government had sanctioned on Wednesday revised pay band and cadre pay scale for the adhyapak cadre with effect from April 1 this year. Besides, the government had also announced that they will be given seniority from the date of appointment. This would lead to an increase in the salaries of the adhyapak cadre from Rs 2300 to 3500. Besides this, the teachers would also be given relaxation in the upper limit of age for direct recruitment by the panchayat and urban self governance bodies who appoint them. The new upper limit of age will be 45 years. The teacher’s body has, however, rejected the announcement by the State government. It has declared that the strike would not be called off until and unless the government implements all the demands of the teachers without any condition. The teachers are demanding that they should be paid salaries equal to the permanent teachers employed under the school education department of the State government they are also demanding a merger in the department as they are currently employed by the local bodies.","The School Education Department in the State capital has initiated disciplinary action against 30 teachers who went on strike, having failed to return to work after receiving a prior warning.

The strike, ongoing for four days, involves various categories of government school teachers, including adhyapakas, contract teachers, and gurujis. The state government recently revised the pay scale for the adhyapak cadre, increasing salaries from Rs 2300 to 3500 and adjusting the upper age limit for recruitment to 45 years.

Dim sum bonds in tandoori land,"In a move that could help them reduce borrowing costs, the Reserve Bank of India last week allowed Indian firms to raise debt in Chinese renminbi, up to a collective total of $1 billion. Indian companies with trading and investment links with China can now settle transactions by borrowing directly in renminbi, instead of raising money in US dollar and converting it to the Chinese currency, which would be more expensive. Trade between India and China has grown at 40% year-on-year and stood at $60 billion last year. China remains India’s largest trading partner, accounting for 9.09% of India’s international trade during 2009-10. Indian power firms could be the biggest beneficiaries. India is targeting 100,000MW of additional electricity capacity in the next five years and needs an investment of over US$400 billion in the power sector to reduce electricity deficits. India’s present power capacity is 170,000MW. Indian firms can now use this facility to finance power sector projects. Power equipment imports from China have been growing rapidly, much to the irritation of local capital goods companies. According to industry lobby Assocham, Indian power producers have placed orders of power plant equipment, for around 50,000 MW generation capacity, from Chinese suppliers, resulting in a “loss"" of about ₹ 50,000 crore to the domestic equipment manufacturing companies. However, there are risks involved as well. The banks through which overseas corporations raise loans are China Exim Bank and China Development Bank (CDB); these are state owned and are known to advance China’s strategic interests even while issuing commercial loans. Critics allege that these banks in the past have suspended loans before the completion of projects to put pressure on the home countries of borrowers to settle unrelated commercial disputes to China’s advantage. It is also risky to borrow in renminbi as it remains undervalued and is not freely tradable in the international financial markets, and the volume of trade remains low in Hong Kong and London currency markets. Also since Indians are not likely to earn revenues in Chinese currency, there cannot be a natural hedge as well.","The Reserve Bank of India has permitted Indian companies to raise debt in Chinese renminbi, up to a total of $1 billion. This move aims to help these firms reduce borrowing costs by allowing them to settle transactions directly in renminbi, rather than converting from US dollars. The initiative is particularly beneficial for Indian power companies seeking to finance projects amid the country's goal of adding 100,000MW of electricity capacity in the next five years. However, there are risks involved, including the state-owned nature of the Chinese banks involved, potential undervaluation of the renminbi, and its limited tradability in international markets.

FE Editorial : Sibal dials right number,"Telecom minister Kapil Sibal?s announcement that, when it is finally announced, the New Telecom Policy 2011 will delink licences from spectrum is a big leap forward in cleaning up the mess that A Raja and various recommendations by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) have created. While Raja?s largesse resulted in a situation where his favoured firms got spectrum at a fraction of its market value, Trai recommended putting the older players at a further disadvantage. While firms like Uninor paid a fraction of the 3G spectrum auction-costs for their spectrum, Trai recommended that firms like Bharti/Vodafone/BSNL/MTNL would pay 1.5 times the 3G rates?for their extra spectrum right now, and at the time when their licences came up for renewal starting 2014. By saying that no spectrum will be given when licences are renewed?it will have to be bid for?Sibal has ensured there will be no scope for favouritism of the Raja kind or through flawed reasoning of the Trai kind in the post-2014 period. There will, of course, be a problem when the Bhartis and Vodafones pay 1.5 times the 3G price for their extra spectrum while the post-2014 spectrum they will get can be at lower auction-determined prices?this, however, is a legacy issue and may need to be endured if it cannot be cured. There are, however, some areas that need some more thought if Sibal?s overarching objective is to be achieved. The easier M&A norms Sibal spoke of are an urgent need, but there is no reason why Sibal should want 6 players to be there in each circle at any point in time. It is better than today?s 14, but there is enough evidence to show that 3-4 players are enough to ensure competitive pricing in most industries, including telecom?in any case, since the existing law only speaks of four players, Sibal may end up making M&A even more restrictive! The 10% cross-holding limit, similarly, is largely irrelevant once there are more than 3-4 players. But, most important, if M&As are to take place, the cap of 15 MHz for a merged entity is the surest way of ensuring no M&As take place?one of the big drivers of M&A is the larger amounts of spectrum available and the consequent savings that result from larger spectrum amounts. Interestingly, Trai has recommended this cap be lowered to 14.4 MHz. Since Sibal has till the end of the year to come out with NTP 2011, hopefully these glitches will be ironed out by then.","While Raja?s largesse resulted in a situation where his favoured firms got spectrum at a fraction of its market value, Trai recommended putting the older players at a further disadvantage.

Power crisis deepens.,"The power cuts in Punjab today increased to more than four hours while the demand for power in the state rose to about 1,400 lakh units. The power supply from all sources has been 1,300 lakh units, said the PSEB sources. The crisis deepened due to the rise in power demand, lesser supply of power from the Naptha Jhakri project and from some others states where flood has damaged hydel projects. Besides, a 110 MW unit in the Bathinda thermal plant had already been closed for the maintenance, the sources added. A senior official of the PSEB said that the increase in the demand for power had already forced the PSEB to purchase 10 lakh units each from Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal every day. Power supply from the Ropar, Lehra Mohabat and Bathinda thermal plants was 465 lakh units while hydel projects supplied 468 lakh units. Power supply from hydel projects was better this year due to a heavy rainfall so far. The BBMB hydel projects are in a much better position this year due to a rise in their water levels. The state is getting 203 lakh units every day from the BBMB and 144 lakh units from Ranjit Sagar Dam. Besides, the state is also getting 408 lakh units from the central grid. The sources said the power crisis had aggravated in the morning as power supply from the Naptha Jakhri project also remained suspended till 10 am. The state has 28 per cent share in the project. The Member, Administrative, PSEB, Mr Raman Bhatia, said that the power cuts in the state were imposed as the state was not getting proper power supply from hydel projects including the Naptha Jhakhri project which had been facing a silt problem.","Power cuts in Punjab have increased to over four hours as the demand for power in the state has risen to about 1,400 lakh units.

SAIL: Investors may have to wait boost in share price,"The stock of Steel authority of India (SAIL) has fallen more than 11% after its September quarter results, as the company disappointed the Street with dismal financial numbers. It reported one-third decrease in its net profit compared to the year-ago quarter. In the next quarter, however, higher steel prices in the past two months and lower raw material costs may offer some solace to the company. SAIL saw an 8-percentage point decrease in its operating margin in the September quarter from a year ago as the company struggled with higher raw material costs and employee expense for the second consecutive quarter. A higher coking coal price was the dampener for the company as it is mainly dependent on outside suppliers like Coal India for this. However in the prevailing quarter, coking coal prices have come down 10%, which will ease out some concern for the company in terms profitability in this quarter. It had faced headwinds due to its high inventory. It had to give discounts to sell the inventory that got accumulated in the first quarter. This is directly visible from a 15% fall in realisation sequentially. Inventory levels are still high and this trend is expected to continue in the coming quarter. SAIL is currently firming up a capex worth Rs 12,250 crore for FY11. The company, however, is struggling to complete its expansion projects on time. The commissioning of 2.4-million tonne per annum blast furnace expansion at Burnpur is getting delayed by six months. The company, on the other hand, has commissioned a blast furnace at BSP after the breakdown in August 2010. This recommissioning will help the company increase its production this quarter. While new capacities and focus on valueadded products might improve SAIL's production in the future, the company however is dependent on the domestic demand to sell its production. Global steel production increased 3.5% year on year in September despite a drop in Chinese output. According to world steel projections, demand would grow more than 13% in FY10, followed by 6% in FY11. Indian steel demand is expected to grow 12% over FY10-12 due to the planned infrastructure investment by the government and a rebound in capex. The company may post better results in the December quarter helped by higher steel prices, lower raw material costs and increased demand after the seasonally weak September quarter. However, investors may have to wait for a major boost in its share price until new capacities go on stream.","Steel Authority of India (SAIL) stock fell over 11% following disappointing September quarter results with a one-third decrease in net profit. Higher raw material costs, reduced operating margins, and high inventory levels contributed to the slump. However, falling coking coal prices, improved steel prices, and expected growth in domestic steel demand may offer some recovery in the December quarter.",Business and Finance,2010-11-19 00:00:00

"Adani Group eyeing opportunities in neighbouring countries after Sri Lanka port, says Karan Adani","Days after announcing a significant $553 million investment from the United States government for its West Container Terminal in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Karan Adani, CEO of Adani Group told reporters Adani Ports is eyeing further “opportunities in our neighboring countries"", Bloomberg reported. Speaking to reporters in Colombo Adani also said the US financing, backed by the International Development Finance Corporation, is a ""reaffirmation"" of international support for the Indian conglomerate's companies. According to Adani, the neighbouring countries include potential ventures in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Tanzania, besides the existing plans in Sri Lanka and Israel. He added that the ports business accounts for 90 percent of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone's revenues, and this trend will continue as the company continues to expand in India. “Trade is booming, we are just doing a catch-up game. We are always short of capacity and that is hurting Indian trade,"" he added. Challenges and Resilience The financing deal comes as a welcome boost for the Adani Group, which faced challenges, including a short-seller attack and corporate fraud allegations. The investment is not only a strategic move for the Adani Group but also signals Washington's endorsement of the port project, aimed at countering China's maritime influence in the crucial Indian Ocean region. While Adani Ports is India's largest operator, with a robust domestic business, challenges persist in scaling up overseas operations to match China's extensive influence in global ports. Despite recent investments and endorsements, the Adani Group faces scrutiny over its business practices, including a resignation by its auditor Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP. The group, however, remains resilient, showing growth capability and financial strength. Looking Beyond China Gautam Adani, the billionaire father and owner of the Adani Group, has openly criticized China in the past. However, the focus remains on expanding and strengthening operations in India. Despite the recent US government loan and investments in Adani's green energy business, challenges lie ahead, Bloomberg noted. Adani Ports may face difficulties in raising funds for expansion amid tight global markets and high debt costs. The conglomerate, nevertheless, maintains a resilient growth capability, and its businesses continue to attract investors despite reputational risks. In a changing landscape where China may be reevaluating big bilateral infrastructure deals, there is a potential opportunity for rival firms like Adani to fill the gap. The Adani Group's expansionary plans reflect a long-term vision, navigating challenges and seeking opportunities in the dynamic world of global infrastructure development.","Karan Adani, CEO of Adani Group, announced the company's interest in exploring opportunities in neighboring countries, including Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Tanzania.

From Ahmedabad to Abingdon: Thakores ready for epic vintage 'car' nama,"Daman Thakore, a seasoned traveller with a heart brimming with wanderlust, is embarking on a daring expedition that intertwines family legacy, a passion for the open road, and a zest for life. From Ahmedabad to Abingdon: Thakores ready for epic vintage 'car' nama The 1950 MG YT is called ‘Lal Pari’. AHMEDABAD: Daman Thakore, a seasoned traveller with a heart brimming with wanderlust, is embarking on a daring expedition that intertwines family legacy, a passion for the open road, and a zest for life. In a celebration of his 50th year, the businessman is setting forth on a remarkable odyssey that spans continents and generations, driving his beloved vintage 1950 MG YT, affectionately known as the 'Lal Pari', from Ahmedabad to its birthplace at the Abingdon factory in London. This audacious cross-continental expedition covering over 12,000 km through 16 countries is more than a road trip. It's a homage to cherished memories and a tribute to his parents, who instilled a love for exploration by embarking on long journeys in the car during the Diwali holidays. Thakores to reach London by October So, it is only fair that he is planning this venture with his 75-yearold father, Deval Thakore, his 21-year-old daughter, Devanshi, and a close-knit group of friends and family.

The Thakores plan to embark on their journey between Tuesday and Thursday next week. They hope to reach London by mid-October. Daman, who runs an agency handling earthmoving equipment, says, “My father believed that if you want to get far, you must go slow. Since I was three years old, I have seen my parents embark on long, sometimes treacherous, road trips — sometimes spontaneously conceived and always executed on shoestring budgets. It appeared implausible, yet these escapades etched indelible lessons within us. “We learnt through the trips to believe in each other and the strangers we met. All we had to do was take the first step. Our journey to London fits this ethos perfectly. The Lal Pari hits a top speed of 60kmph but we will cruise at a speed of 35kmph.

China effect lifts colour TV exports,"NEW DELHI: China''s loss could be India''s gain. Indian CTV manufacturers â€” facing a raw deal at home thanks to aggressive competition from Korean chaebols LG and Samsung â€” may have finally found a growth opportunity. Thanks to trade barriers in the US against Chinese imports, Indian CTV manufacturers â€” from Videocon to Onida to BPL â€” are getting a foothold in the lucrative, $100-billion home electronics market in the US. US has imposed anti-dumping duties of up to 78.45% on CTVs from China,threatened by surging Chinese exports. Exports of 21-inch and larger CTVs from China to the US rose from 56,295 in 2001 to nearly 1.76 million last year, threatening manufacturing jobs across the US. Videocon has made the first move by exporting 20-inches and 21-inches flat CTVs priced at about $100 each, after enquiries began coming a couple of months back, says VN Dhoot, the company''s CMD. To begin with, Videocon is targeting exports of 5 lakh units a year to the US. ""The US market is obviously lucrative. Our CTV exports to Italy and West Asia put together account for about 3 lakh units a year,"" says Dhoot. For Onida, which exports CTVs to Dubai, the US is a long-term and interesting opportunity for exports, says G Sundar, COO. CTV exports account for 10% of Onida''s sales. BPL, which has been exporting to Europe all along, is actively exploring the US market, says Manmohan Ganesh of BPL. ""We have exported colour monitors to the US in the past, but CTVs is definitely on the agenda now in the backdrop of anti-dumping duties in the US against China,"" says Ganesh. Analysts say for Onida which has stabilised, and Videocon, which has brand presence through Sansui, move is a growth opportunity for supplementing domestic sales. But for BPL, it could be only hope. ""Exports to US could possibly be the last survival strategy BPL is left with, considering that its market share in CTVs has plummeted to 5-6%,"" say analysts. LG and Samsung together control close to 35% of the domestic CTV market, estimated at over 7-million-units-a-year and growing at about 12% annually. While LG leads with a market share of about 17-18%, Samsung is at the second slot with a share of close to 15% share. Onida''s share, at No 3, is about 12%, Sansui''s share is in the region of 10-11% and Videocon is at about 9%.","The news discusses how Indian consumer television (CTV) manufacturers are finding an opportunity in the US market due to trade barriers against Chinese imports. With anti-dumping duties imposed on Chinese CTVs, companies like Videocon, Onida, and BPL are eyeing the lucrative US home electronics market. Videocon has already initiated exports, targeting 5 lakh units annually. Onida sees it as a long-term opportunity, while BPL views it as a survival strategy amidst declining market share domestically. The dominance of Korean companies LG and Samsung in the Indian CTV market is also highlighted.",Business and Finance,2004-05-01 00:00:00

"Rakesh Jhunjhunwala stock: Federal Bank shares may rally 13% soon; derivatives, quantitative outlook strong","Rakesh Jhunjhunwala-owned Federal Bank stock could be gearing up for a 13% rally in just three months, analysts at ICICI Direct said in a report. The brokerage firm has picked the banking sector stock as their quant pick, backed by derivative and quantitative data. Federal Bank’s share price is up 26% so far this year to now trade at Rs 110 per share, outperforming the benchmark indices. Analysts expect the stock to surge to a target of Rs 124 per share. The stock is part of Big Bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s portfolio, owning 7.57 crore equity shares of Federal Bank along with his wife Rekha Jhunjhunwala. ICICI Direct noted that banking and financial stocks are witnessing a strong recovery and were the major drivers in the recent up move seen in the Nifty. Although consolidation could be on the cards for Nifty but sectoral heavyweights, select private banks, especially Federal Bank, is likely to do well, according to ICICI Direct. “With fresh longs, the stock was able to surpass its intermediate hurdle and Call base of Rs 100 post its quarterly results. We believe with short positions out of the system and accumulation of fresh longs, there should be a further swift up move in the stock,” analysts noted. Federal Bank share price has been resilient this year and in particular, in recent weeks, soaring 18% in July alone. On the options front, Federal Bank has the highest Call open interest (OI) at 110 strike for the current monthly F&O series. As the stock is above those levels, closure is visible across Call strikes. “With initial signs of closure among Call writers, we expect the stock to outperform the indices throughout the august series. On the other hand, writing is visible in 105, 100 Put strikes that should act as support on downsides,” the report said. Further, the delivery has also been supportive of the stock helping Federal Bank cross 100 levels. “We believe this accumulation will maintain positive momentum in the stock above said levels. The delivery Z-Score has again started to move into the positive territory since last month as the stock is witnessing fresh accumulation in the delivery segment,” analysts added. ICICI Direct sees a three-month time frame for this stock with a stop loss at Rs 97.8 per share. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Rekha Jhunjhunwala own 7,57,21,060 equity shares of Federal Bank or a 3.64% stake in the lender.

On Wednesday evening, the police had taken a few BJP and Sangh Parivar leaders into preventive custody to check untoward incidents during the hartal.

The services returned to normality after 6 p.m. The police deployed their official vehicles to transport those stranded at the Kottayam railway station. Sabarimala pilgrims from other States, who reached Kottayam on trains, were put to immense hardship in the absence of vehicles for their onward journey. The closing down of all commercial establishments, including restaurants, added to their misery. A tense situation prevailed in Kottayam town as protesters converged on the streets since the morning. Unlike on previous occasions, the hartal had a near-total impact on the Erumely town, which is generally exempted from such protests during the annual pilgrim season at Sabarimala. While KSRTC operated a few services to Sabarimala in the morning, the shops operating in the temple town here were forced to close down. The DYFI workers offered food and water to Sabarimala pilgrims. They also took out a rally in Manarcaud against the hartal.","Kottayam experienced an uneasy calm during a day-long hartal (strike) called by the Sabarimala Karama Samithi and supported by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). There were sporadic clashes reported in different areas, including Ponkunnam, Thalayolaparambu, and Pampady. Incidents included stone-throwing at a supermarket, damage to political party flags and boards, and injuries to two BJP workers during a rally. To prevent disturbances, the police had detained some BJP and Sangh Parivar leaders the previous evening. The strike disrupted daily life as private buses and autorickshaws remained off the road, while only 25 special bus services operated by KSRTC were available. The situation returned to normal after 6 p.m., but Sabarimala pilgrims, particularly those arriving by train from other states, faced difficulties due to a lack of transportation.

Against governors,"I f the office of the state governor didn ' t exist, no republican democracy would invent it. A state ' s governor is a provincial pro- consul. In British India, its institutional necessity was obvious: the governor represented viceregal authority in the same way as the viceroy represented the British monarch ' s imperial prerogative. In colonial India not only was the governor ' s office unaccountable to the people of that province or presidency, it was designed to be unaccountable. The clarity of this authoritarian arrangement was muddled by the introduction of the electoral principle at the level of provincial government in the early decades of the twentieth century. Where previously the governor ruled through colonial civil servants who administered the state, the Montagu- Chelmsford reforms introduced a hybrid ruling arrangement sometimes described as ' dyarchy ' where some administrative departments were allotted to elected legislators while the more important ones remained in the charge of ' civilians ' — colonial bureaucrats. It was the Government of India Act of 1935 that created this odd cohabitation where a nominated governor, generally an ICS veteran, had to retreat to a titular supremacy, ceding administrative authority to the elected head of government, the Premier, as the chief minister of a province was then described. The tension between the two offices was palpable, with the Congress in 1937 holding out for, and receiving, assurances from the viceroy, that provincial governors would have no jurisdiction over the political administration of the province. When the Congress governments resigned from provincial office in 1939 in protest against Britain declaring war on behalf of India, the colonial government was delighted because these provinces reverted to governor ' s rule, the colonial equivalent of president ' s rule. It was much easier to run the war effort without pesky interference from the representatives of British India ' s subjectcitizens. These colonial pro- consuls survived Independence because the founding fathers were anxious about political unity and, therefore, willing to weaken the principle of federal autonomy to strengthen Central authority. They endorsed the retention of the office of governor. For them, a governor was to the province what the president was to the nation: the guardian of republican authority and its continuity by virtue of being removed from the political fray. Nearly seven decades of lived democracy have confirmed what the framers of the Constitution could not have then known: far from safeguarding constitutional propriety, governors have acted as the Central government ' s partisan agents. They have dismissed inconvenient governments, subverted democratic verdicts, thwarted the functioning of elected state governments hostile to the ruling party at the Centre and behaved more like colonial Residents in a princely state than the discreet republican referees that they were meant to be. There have been governors of great distinction just as there have been governors who have been corrupt, overbearing time- servers and so it is sometimes argued that the frailties of individual men and women should not be allowed to discredit the office. This is a bad argument: it obscures the fact that it is the institutional design of the office that leads its incumbents astray, not their character or the lack of it. The governor ' s office is different from the president ' s in two crucial respects. First, the Constitution lays down a procedure for the president ' s election and defines the electoral college. The electoral process gives the presidency political legitimacy. The governor, in contrast, is merely appointed by the president on the advice of the Central government. Secondly, unlike the president, a governor does not have a fixed term; he holds office at the pleasure of the ruling party in Delhi. Both the manner of the appointment and the uncertainty of tenure conspire to make the incumbent a creature of the Central government in politically charged circumstances rather than a disinterested umpire. The governor is best seen as a residual political organ that survived the Indian State ' s evolution from colony to republic. The splendour of the palaces that governors inhabit gives their political bloodlines away. The anomalousness of the office in a federal or even quasi- federal republic isn ' t hard to illustrate. India is far from being the only parliamentary democracy with provincial legislatures; Australia and Germany are two countries that offer useful comparative context. The Australian instance underlines the colonial provenance of governorship. Australia ' s past as a British settler colony left it with autonomous provinces where elected premiers were monitored by governors appointed by the British monarch on the advice of Britain ' s foreign secretary. Australian governors sometimes sparked political controversies similar to the ones provoked by their Indian counterparts by using their reserve powers to dismiss state governments or by refusing to notify their recommendations. These controversies were minimized once elected premiers were given the right to propose the governors they wanted for their provinces. The Australian example illustrates the extent to which the office of governor is an imperial hold- over that survives because the concerted constitutional energy needed to abolish it is hard to muster. It is the German example that demonstrates the redundancy of the position. Like India, Germany is a parliamentary democracy that replicates parliamentary legislatures in its states or Länder . At the national level, as in India, the ceremonial head of state is the president while the head of government is the chancellor. But German Länder or states only have heads of governments, chief ministerequivalents known as minister- presidents. Germany ' s political structure demonstrates that there is no constitutional need to mirror the office of the head of state at the provincial level. It is only in countries with histories of authoritarian colonial rule that this position even exists. It could be argued that since India is a subcontinental republic anxious about its political integrity, the Government of India needs the option of intervening in the affairs of a state in times of crisis or emergency and the governor ' s main function is to act as its proxy at these times. The fact is that the Central government is empowered to dismiss a state government under certain circumstances with or without the recommendation of the governor. There is no reason why the responsibility for the administration of a province during the temporary expedient of president ' s rule should require a governor. The responsibility could just as well go by default to the chief secretary, the province ' s senior- most civil servant. If the brief during president ' s rule is to keep the machinery of government running in a non- partisan way till such time as fresh elections throw up a new government, much better that the task is performed by a neutral career bureaucrat than a politically appointed carpetbagger, which is essentially what governors are. There is no reason why senior civil servants shouldn ' t rise to the occasion to keep the wheels of provincial government turning during these interregnums. It is by now obvious that the function for which governors have become most notorious, the swearing in of a government when a state election hasn ' t thrown up an obvious political majority, is one for which they are uniquely ill- fitted. As political partisans who serve at the pleasure of the ruling party at the Centre, they are not credible arbiters. In the wake of the Karnataka governor ' s predictable attempt to load the dice in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party after the recent, inconclusive election in that state and the Supreme Court ' s intervention that forced a swift floor test, editorialists have called upon the apex court to codify the processes to be followed by the governor in the event of a hung assembly. A strict code that reduces gubernatorial discretion is an excellent idea; it would be an even better one if the task of implementing these guidelines was taken away from the governor and handed over to the Election Commission. The statutory body that conducts and supervises the largest and most challenging democratic processes in the world is selfevidently the institution best equipped to steward those processes to their political conclusion. Should the Supreme Court ' s writ in Karnataka- like situations be implemented by a neutral, statutory body that has the trust of India ' s electorate ( despite eccentric accusations of EVM fraud) or should it be entrusted to politically beholden operatives waiting for covert instructions in echoing Raj Bhavans? To ask the question is to know the answer. If governors can ' t be legislated out of existence ( as they should be), the next best move would be to shrink the office to fit the men that fill it.","The state governorship in India mirrors a colonial-era pro-consul setup, carrying over from British rule to the republic. Originally unaccountable, the role evolved into a hybrid structure through colonial reforms, yet remains contentious due to its Centre-backed, politically appointed nature. Unlike the president, governors lack an electoral process and hold uncertain terms, making them partisan extensions of the ruling party. Drawing parallels with Australia and Germany, the governor's role appears redundant, raising questions about their necessity and function in a federal system. Restricting their discretionary powers and shifting responsibilities to neutral entities like the Election Commission could offer more impartial governance solutions.",Opinion and Editorial,2018-05-24 00:00:00

EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS IN THE NORTHEAST STATES AND HIMALAYAN REGION,"The Himalayan region, which falls under the Seismic Zone IV and V, is a tectonically active region and the region has experienced strong earthquakes several times. The convergence of the Indian and Eurasian plates in the Himalayan region creates two subduction zones, making it seismically active. Research show that over 59% of India’s landmass is prone to earthquake and fall under various seismic zones. Within India, the Himalayan regions are at high risk of seismic activities and prone to earthquake. Increasing Seismic Activities For over 700 years, the region has been under tectonic stress and enough strains have been accumulated to trigger strong earthquakes that can have serious impact on the lives of millions. Over the past three decades, there has been an increase in earthquake frequency, indicating continuous tectonic activity. A study of seismic activities in the Himalayan region show a sharp spike in the frequency of earthquakes after 2000. Data from 1960-70 shows about 100 earthquakes per year in the Himalayan region, but after 2000, the frequency has gone up to 500-600 earthquakes of varying intensity. Some of the most devastating earthquakes in the Himalayan region and India over the past 150 years are: - 1897 (Shillong) – 8.0 magnitude, more than 1500 people dead - 1905 (Kangra) – 7.8 magnitude, more than 20000 people dead - 1934 (Nepal) – 8.0 magnitude, between 6000 – 10000 people dead - 1935 (Quetta) – 7.7 magnitude, between 30,000–60,000 people dead - 1950 (Assam) – 8.6 magnitude, between 1500 – 3000 people dead - 1991 Uttarkashi – 6.8 magnitude, about 2000 people dead - 1993 (Latur) – 6.2 magnitude, over 9000 people dead - 2001 (Gujarat) – 7.7 magnitude, about 20000 people dead - 2005 (Kashmir) – 7.6 magnitude, about 88000 people dead - 2011 (Sikkim) – 6.9 magnitude, over 100 people dead - 2015 (Nepal) – 7.8 magnitude, about 10000 people dead - 2023 (Nepal) – about 6.0 magnitude, over 150 people dead Apart from the loss of lives, the earthquakes have caused huge loss of properties, and in many cases, triggered other natural disasters like landslides, rockfalls, liquefaction, fires, flooding, and glacial lake outbursts. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, present unforeseen challenges, testing our preparedness in ways often overlooked. In any natural disaster, emergency services get overwhelmed, and are many times unable to respond effectively during such events. Despite all warnings and red flags by scientists, the earthquake of April 25, 2015 in Nepal, caught experts and inhabitants off guard, revealing a lack of adequate preparation. The very recent earthquake of Nov 3, 2023 in Nepal destroyed 11,000 houses affecting around 14,000 families and caused 157 fatalities.","The Himalayan region, a tectonically active region, has experienced strong earthquakes several times due to the convergence of Indian and Eurasian plates.

Explained: Why Maruti Suzuki Shares Surged Over 5%; Uttar Pradesh Waives Registration Fees for Hybrid Vehicles,"The stock price of the India's leading automaker, Maruti Suzuki, on Tuesday (July 9), surged over 5 per cent, in the wake of the Uttar Pradesh governments latest decision to promote green mobility, in which the company holds a strong market share in this segment. The shares of the company at 12:36 pm IST were trading at Rs 12,833.85, up by 6.74 per cent. Uttar Pradesh’s Green Move: Waiving Registration Fees The Uttar Pradesh government in a recent development announced a complete waiver on registration fees for strong hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). What Are HEVs and PHEVs?One of the main difference between the two is that PHEVs come with a larger battery that needs to be charged from an external power source, while HEVs rely on a combination of an internal combustion engine and a smaller battery. Maruti Suzuki’s Advantage The Maruti Suzuki, one of the major player in the EV sector, is expected to gain from this Uttar Pradesh government new policy, especially through its popular models featuring hybrid technology. The Grand Vitara SUV and the Invicto MPV are two prominent vehicles in their lineup that benefit directly from the registration fee waiver.The Grand Vitara is equipped with a hybrid powertrain and combines a 1.5-litre petrol engine with an electric motor. Meanwhile, the Invicto MPV is a hybrid version of the Toyota Innova Hycross, featuring a 2.0-litre petrol engine paired with an e-CVT transmission. Moreover, this model stands out with a combined system power of 186PS. Furthermore, the company is also planning to introduce a range of new electric and hybrid vehicles in the coming years: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) - Starting in 2024, Maruti Suzuki will begin producing BEVs, with a mid-SUV model offering a substantial 550 km range on a 60 kWh battery.Future EV Plans - By 2030 -31, the company aims for EVs to make up 15 per cent of its sales, with hybrids at 25 per cent, and the remaining 60 per cent divided among CNG, biofuels, and internal combustion engines.","Maruti Suzuki's stock surged over 5% on Tuesday, July 9, following Uttar Pradesh government's decision to waive registration fees for strong hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).

India-US Af-Pak initiative pushed back due to Covid-19,"WASHINGTON: US defence secretary Mark Esper has put off a trip to India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, scheduled for next week to help contain the spread of Covid-19 in America. Esper was due to visit the three countries from March 16-20 but he decided “to remain in the US to help manage the Department of Defence (DoD) response”, said Pentagon spokeswoman Alyssa Farah. She said Esper’s trip would now occur at a later date. Esper’s proposed visit, close on the heels on the US President’s India trip, was aimed at dialogue on Af-Pak situation and expansion of defence partnership based on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-President Donald Trump summit. Afghanistan would have dominated Esper’s discussions in both Delhi and Islamabad as the process entered a crucial phase following the signing of the US-Taliban deal, said people aware of the matter. The deal envisaged a host of measures, including release of thousands of prisoners by both sides of the conflict, intra-Afghan dialogue and firm guarantees by the Taliban not to allow the Afghan soil to be used by terrorist groups. Esper’s visit would have also helped take forward Indo-US defence partnership. Modi and Trump pledged at their February 25 summit to deepen defence and security cooperation, especially through greater maritime and space domain awareness and information sharing; joint cooperation; exchange of military liaison personnel and advanced training.","US Defense Secretary Mark Esper has postponed his trip to India, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

"Daring move: Elon Musk deletes Tesla, SpaceX Facebook pages","Verified Facebook pages of Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) disappeared on March 23, minutes after the Silicon Valley billionaire promised on Twitter to take down the pages when challenged by users.

Facebook pages of SpaceX and Tesla, which had millions of followers, are no longer accessible. Musk had begun the exchange by responding to a tweet from WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton on the #deletefacebook tag. The hashtag gained prominence after the world’s largest social network upset users by mishandling data, which ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica - a political consultancy that worked on U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign. “What’s Facebook?” Musk tweeted. Many users also urged the billionaire to delete the profiles of his companies on Facebook’s photo-sharing app Instagram. “I don’t use FB & never have, so don’t think I’m some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don’t advertise or pay for endorsements, so ... don’t care.” Musk has had run-ins with Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg in the past. Last year, a war of words broke out between Musk and Zuckerberg over whether robots will become smart enough to kill their human creators.

Vice-Prez battle on; NDA fields Jaswant,"BJP leader and former external affairs minister Jaswant Singh was today picked by the NDA as its vice-presidential candidate to take on the UPA nominee Hamid Ansari. The decision was taken at a meeting of NDA leaders held at BJP patriarch LK Advani’s residence this morning. Although the numbers clearly favour the UPA nominee, the BJP-led NDA decided not to give the ruling combine a walk-over for two reasons. One, it wanted to record its opposition to Ansari’s candidature. Two, it wished to dispel the widespread perception that the NDA is not united as this view had gathered currency after two of its partners, Janata Dal (U) and the Shiv Sena, broke ranks with the BJP to support UPA candidate Pranab Mukherjee in the Presidential election. Both the Shiv Sena and the JD(U) have supported Jaswant Singh’s candidature which was endorsed unanimously at today’s NDA meeting. Announcing Jaswant Singh’s candidature, Advani disclosed that the BJP had requested Janata Dal (U) president Sharad Yadav to contest for the post of Vice-President but he declined the offer. BJP leader Sushma Swaraj had approached Yadav a few days ago but JD(U) chief refused on the plea that he was more in the mould of a political activist and was not temperamentally suited for a constitutional post. “We are disinclined towards UPA’s Vice-President candidate Hamid Ansari. Sushma had spoken to Sharad Yadav. But he had refused to accept our proposal. Jaswant Singh will be our candidate for the Vice-President’s post,” Advani announced. In his first response to his nomination, Jaswant Singh said, “I am honoured with the responsibility given to me.” The senior BJP leader also made it a point to underline that unlike the presidential election, the NDA will be voting unitedly in the Vice-President’s poll. This view was subsequently endorsed by the JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav. “It was important to send out a political message that the NDA is not breaking up,” Yadav told The Tribune after the meeting. Advani said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh did call him on Saturday to solicit BJP’s support for Ansari but he declined as their party and other NDA partners did not favour a second term for the incumbent Vice-President. The Opposition is particularly unhappy with his handling of the debate of the Lokpal Bill in the Rajya Sabha December last and his decision to summon marshalls during the discussion on the women’s reservation Bill.","The NDA has unanimously nominated BJP leader Jaswant Singh as its vice-presidential candidate to challenge UPA’s Hamid Ansari. Despite UPA's numerical advantage, NDA seeks to demonstrate unity and opposition to Ansari’s handling of key parliamentary issues.

Will save democracy’: Cong on foundation day,"The Congress kicked off its campaign for the 2024 general elections with a mega rally in Nagpur on Thursday, promising a minimum support income, a nationwide caste census and employment for the young, as it hailed Opposition unity and fired salvos at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The rally — organised on the occasion of the 139th anniversary of its foundation day — was named “Hain Taiyyar Hum” (we are ready) and held in Nagpur, which hosts the headquarters of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fountainhead of the BJP. In the event, attended by nearly 100,000 people, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the party was prepared to save the country from destruction and ready for the ideological battle in next year’s polls. He framed the elections as a clash between the Congress’s vision of empowerment and freedom and the BJP’s alleged ideology of hate and inequality. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said the party was committed to implementing the Nyay scheme — which was part of its 2019 manifesto and promised cash up to ₹72,000 annually to the bottom 20% of families — especially for women. Speaking in Marathi, Kharge also said Nagpur was the land of revolutionaries where BR Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi once worked, and that the BJP will finish democracy if it came back to power. Gandhi attacked the BJP for questioning the Congress’s contribution to the country and said that before Independence, princely states were “in partnership with the British”, while it was the Constitution shaped by Mahatma Gandhi, BR Ambedkar and Jawaharlal Nehru that protected the people’s rights and gave every citizen the right to vote. “The people in the RSS and BJP were against this... for years they never saluted the national flag,” he alleged. Gandhi said the BJP’s ideology was that of kings who did not listen to anyone. Citing a conversation with an unnamed BJP member of Parliament who was earlier with the Congress, Gandhi said that the BJP treated its workers and leaders poorly and when an order came from the top, it had to be adhered to. “Some days back, a BJP MP met me in Lok Sabha. He was in Congress earlier. He met me with fear. He said that he wants to speak to me. I asked him why he wants to speak to me as he is in BJP. He was tensed. He told me that he can’t tolerate as he is in BJP but his heart is in Congress. This means that he is fearful of getting back in Congress. I asked him why he is not happy in BJP as he has become an MP. He told me, ‘BJP me gulami chalti hai. Whatever the high command says, we have to do it. We don’t have a choice’,” Gandhi said. He said current Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole had to leave the BJP after questioning Modi on farmers’ issues. In the Congress, in contrast, the concerns of workers are listened to by all higher-ups including him, Gandhi added. The rally comes weeks after the Congress suffered a drubbing in three key heartland states, unable to retain its governments in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, and failing to displace the Bharatiya Janata Party in Madhya Pradesh. The party won Telangana in a strong showing but with just months left for the general elections, its poor performance in north India that accounts for at least 225 Lok Sabha seats is a cause of concern. On Wednesday, the Congress announced Gandhi will undertake a 6,200km-long Bharat Nyay Yatra from the northeastern tip of India to its western shore between January and March, in what was a reiteration of a Kanyakumari-to-Kashmir Bharat Jodo foot march that galvanised workers but produced mixed electoral dividends. In his 35-minute speech, Gandhi said Nagpur was chosen for the party’s grand revival rally as it was in this land that the battle of ideologies started almost a century ago. Accusing the BJP and RSS of consolidating power over democratic institutions, he criticised the central government for exerting control over institutions and said investigative agencies operated under government pressure. The people of India including women had no rights before Independence and Dalits were subjected to untouchability, Gandhi said, alleging that “this was the ideology of the RSS which Congress changed, and these people want to bring back the pre-Independence era situation again.” “The foundation of the battle for political power is ideology and the Congress’s objective is to hand over power to the common man,” he said. He also made a strong pitch for the 28-party Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA). “The BJP government has pushed a large number of people back into poverty…We do not want two Indias. Only the INDIA alliance can provide employment to the youth,” Gandhi said. He reiterated that after coming to power, INDIA will conduct a caste survey. “How many youth have been given employment in the last ten years by the Modi government? Unemployment is at an all-time high now,” the Congress leader said. Other backward classes (OBC), Dalits and tribals do not have representation commensurate with their population in many sectors, Gandhi said. “Earlier, PM Modi would describe himself as an OBC. But after my demand (of caste census), he says there is only one caste, the poor. If there is only one caste, why do you say you are an OBC,” the Congress leader asked. Kharge said Nagpur was associated with two ideologies — the “regressive” one of the RSS and the “progressive” one of BR Ambedkar, who led hundreds of thousands of his followers to Buddhism in a landmark event in 1956 at Deekshabhoomi in the city. “If the BJP and RSS came to power again, democracy will be finished. There are two ideologies in Nagpur, one is the progressive one which belongs to Ambedkar, and other is that of the RSS which is destroying the country,” the veteran leader said. Modi was against social justice and equality, Kharge alleged. “Democracy is under threat. Inflation has skyrocketed, unemployment is also high. There are 30 lakh vacancies which are not being filled up because Backward Classes would have to be accommodated,” he said. The poor are becoming more poor while the rich are becoming richer under the Modi government, Kharge said. “If the INDIA alliance is voted to power, the Nyay scheme will be implemented for the empowerment of the poor including women,” he said. Senior BJP leader and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who hails from Nagpur, dubbed the Congress event as a “micro” rally. “The Congress had boasted it was going to be a mammoth rally. But after seeing the public response, it can be easily said it turned out to be a micro rally,” he said.","The Congress party initiated its 2024 general election campaign with a large rally in Nagpur, emphasizing minimum support income, a caste census, and youth employment. The event, named ""Hain Taiyyar Hum"" (we are ready), aimed to highlight opposition unity and critique Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP. Rahul Gandhi framed the elections as a clash between Congress's vision of empowerment and BJP's alleged ideology of hate. Congress Chief Mallikarjun Kharge pledged to implement the Nyay scheme, especially for women, while criticizing BJP's governance. Gandhi accused BJP of disregarding worker and leader concerns and shared an anecdote highlighting BJP's alleged authoritarianism. The rally followed Congress's recent electoral setbacks in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh. Gandhi announced a Bharat Nyay Yatra and emphasized Nagpur's significance in ideological battles. He criticized BJP and RSS for undermining democratic institutions and stressed INDIA alliance's role in addressing poverty and unemployment. Kharge highlighted Nagpur's association with BR Ambedkar's progressive ideology and warned against BJP's return to power.

"Budget 2022 | Laying the roadmap towards India@100: Nitya Sharma, CEO & co-founder, Simpl","The Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) has provided timely credit to more than 130 lakh MSMEs and helped them tide over the pandemic crisis. By Nitya Sharma The Budget 2022-23 aims to build a digital and resilient economy by facilitating India’s vision at 100 years post-Independence with the collective effort ‘Sabka Prayas’ of all sections of society. The finance minister elaborated on the government’s focus to complement macroeconomic growth with a micro-all-inclusive welfare approach, boosting the digital economy, encouraging fintech to flourish and maintaining a greater focus on tech-enabled development, energy transition and climate action Financial inclusion remains the priority Recognising the importance of seamless online funds transfer via digital modes, one welcomes the finance minister’s announcements to cover 100% of 1.5 lakh post offices under the core banking system. This would further strengthen financial inclusion by facilitating access to accounts through net banking, mobile banking, ATMs, and allowing online transfer of funds between post office accounts and bank accounts. Farmers and senior citizens in rural regions would be key beneficiaries of this financial inclusion initiative. Digital payments as a growth lever Reiterating the crucial role played by digital payments, the FM has lauded the contribution of fintech players. To accelerate digital adoption, the FM has encouraged the proliferation of digital payments platforms that provide user-friendly and economical payments options. This was reflected in the continued financial support of Rs 1,500 crore to the digital payments space with an extension till 2022-23. The FM has also urged that villages and rural regions deserve to have access to the same digital resources as their counterparts in the urban areas. The introduction of the digital rupee via secure blockchain would be a landmark step in boosting the digital infrastructure and digital security within the country. Mobile connectivity Universal internet connectivity is the bedrock of a vibrant digital ecosystem and digital payments landscape. As a right step in this direction, the FM has expedited spectrum auction for the rollout of 5G mobile services by private telecom players in 2022 itself. Design-led manufacturing towards 5G would be included as part of the PLI scheme towards enabling affordable broadband and mobile communication in rural and remote areas with 5% of annual collection under USOs fund to be allocated as financial aid. Start-ups as growth engines and job creators Reaffirming support to the start-up community as enablers of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the FM has capped the surcharge on long-term capital gains arising on the transfer of any type of assets at 15%. This is expected to further attract investments in start-ups. The tax incentives for three consecutive years out of 10 years from incorporation has been extended with the period of incorporation of eligible start-ups being valid up to 31 March 2023. The positive sentiments toward start-up success stories, with the FM formally recognising start-ups as the growth drivers of the Indian economy, would go a long way in further promoting entrepreneurship. Credit offtake to augment entrepreneurship It is well-known that adequate credit is the lifeline for business entities, especially SMEs. It is noteworthy that the FM has reaffirmed the government’s focus on credit facilities as a key proponent for formalising the economy and enhancing entrepreneurial opportunities for all. Revamping of the Credit Guarantee Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) scheme with additional funds infusion would expand the credit line up to Rs 2 lakh crore for micro and small enterprises and expand employment opportunities. The Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) has provided timely credit to more than 130 lakh MSMEs and helped them tide over the pandemic crisis. Traversing the path of fiscal discipline towards economic resilience The FM has reiterated the government’s commitment to balance fiscal rectitude with the achievement of growth objectives by pegging the fiscal deficit for FY23 at 6.4% of GDP and further containing the gap to 4.5% of GDP by FY26. With a 9.2% growth estimate for the current FY2022 and improved health infrastructure, the Indian economy is in a strong and resilient position to overcome all challenges, including black-swan events of a similar magnitude such as the pandemic.","The Budget 2022-23 emphasizes digitalization, financial inclusion, and startup support. Initiatives include expanding digital payments, enhancing mobile connectivity, easing taxation for startups, boosting credit availability, and maintaining fiscal discipline. The Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme aided over 130 lakh MSMEs during the pandemic.",Business and Finance,2023-02-02 00:00:00

https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shikhar-dhawan-aims-to-play-consistent-cricket-on-sri-lanka-tour/,"India opener Shikhar Dhawan on Sunday said the “controlled and aggressive” nature of skipper Virat Kohli rubs on the entire team and fires up the players to be more attacking on the field.“He (Kohli) is really controlled and aggressive in the field and that brings an aggressiveness on all the players too and we are also more attacking towards the opponents,” said Dhawan ahead of the upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka.Dhawan and Kohli have been friends for long time and have played Ranji Trophy for Delhi. Asked about their friendship, the left-hander said,”We are still the same and it is not that something has changed. It is good that my captain has expectations from me and I hope I play consistently for my team.”Talking about the upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka, Dhawan said, “It is going to be a good series. They have also got a young side and we also don’t have a mature Test side so it is going to be a good competition.”Asked about competition for the opening slot, Dhawan said, “I think it is a good thing for Indian cricket that there is so much competition for opening slot. Players put in more effort because you can be kicked out if you don’t play well and make mistakes. I take it positively and try to ensure that I give my best.”Dhawan, who had scored fastest Test ton on debut against Australia in 2013, said it is good to have batsmen who can score runs quickly in modern day Test cricket.“In Test cricket now, you also need players who can score quickly, it has became very important because sometimes in second innings or first innings if you score quicky it helps the team. I have always been like that, so it doesn’t bother me,” he said.“I just try to keep it simple. if I get a good delivery, I just defend it and If I get a loose ball then I hit it and make runs,” Dhawan said.Asked what is going to be his approach in Sri Lanka, he said,”It depends on wicket. If the wicket is turning, it will be difficult for the batsman to play the spinner. Then you have to be more careful. You can’t go and play your shots easily on a a fast-bowling track also.”“You have to respect the bowler and every batsmen have their way of tackling the spinners.”India off-spinner R Ashwin said it will be a good series where two new teams will express themselves.“Any team that plays at home backyard has an advantage, so they will know what is going to come and how conditions will pan out. We are prepared in terms of what their strength and weakness are. As professionals, we will do our best,” he said.“In terms of senior or junior batsmen, I think Mehela (Jayawardene) is gone but Sanga (Kumar Sangakkara) is still going to play a couple of Tests and to be a part of that historic Test is fine. It is going to be back to two new teams getting together and expressing themselves. It is going to be a good series.”Asked about the conditions in Sri Lanka, Ashwin said: “The conditions in Sri Lanka, somehow, I have this feeling it will be spinning wickets. Sri Lanka had their fast bowlers picking up wickets. So you never know. Everyday we play according to the conditions and strengths of opponents. So I won’t be surprise if we get wickets that do little bit for the seamers.”To a question, Ashwin said he always tries to get better by doing things differently.“You try to play as close to the basic as possible. I read a lot, I went through the various coaching materials and I went to the coaches and I started getting answers and I started innovating my game. I try and see if I can roll my wrist differently, roll up differently but I am trying to giveit a shot and sometimes it turns out to be fantastic and sometimes rubbish,” the India off-spinner said.Asked about Nathan Lyon, who was the standout bowler for Australia with 3-36 from 12 overs in the third Ashes Test, Ashwin said, “I like few aspect of Nathan Lyon. If you see, he wasn’t playing before the last Ashes when they went to England. When he came into England, he changed his action, he was getting side arm of the crease, he was producing some kind of momentum, that was a different change.“To see someone like him do a change in international cricket, it was pleasing for me. From spinners point of view, It is much more harder when you are traveling away from home because the basics don’t always stick on to the same way.”Talking about his batting, Ashwin, who used to be an opening batsman at junior-level cricket, said, “I love my batting. I can contribute, I have contributed in the past and it is not like I average much, I bat at 8 and as far as positions are concerned, if I give importance to position thenI might not be able to contribute.”“I will give my best yard in nets and see how it goes, I try and play my natural shots, give my best and see how it goes in Test cricket. It is not rocket science, I think I will just go and enjoy.”","India opener Shikhar Dhawan praised the ""controlled and aggressive"" leadership style of skipper Virat Kohli, stating it inspires the team to adopt a more attacking approach on the field. Ahead of the Test series against Sri Lanka, Dhawan expressed confidence in the competition within the team, emphasizing that it motivates players to perform better. He remarked on the significance of having players who can score quickly in modern Test cricket, highlighting his own aggressive batting style.

Shreyas was also heaped praise on left arm seamer Mitchell Starc, picked up in the auction for a record amount and the Aussie rose to the occasion with commanding show in the last two games. Starc, who rocked the top order of SRH in the all important summit clash, was declared man of the match for picking up two wickets in his first three overs.

This is what we demanded from the players and they stood up”, he said, amid jubilations at the dug out, after becoming the eighth captain to win the crown in a surprisngly low-scoring affair. The bowlers did the job, with SRH losing wickets at regular intervals and their batsmen falling like nine pins.

So much to cherish right now”. “Today, we were lucky enough to bowl first. Everything went in our way. Congrats to SRH for the way they played throughout. It was a high-pressure game and Mitchell Starc had been so good off-field”, he said. “Phenomenal work ethic, something to learn for youngsters”, he added.

Besides yearning for leaders to serve humans we should also elevate and choose leaders who support and educate people about our mother nature. We can also learn lessons from country like Bhutan which is the only carbon negative country in the world having similar landscapes like ours. They are even further working to improve more in their environmental statistics. Thanks to their leaders and their supporting citizens too. I believe it is time for us to come to realisation and preserve our nature. More encouragements and education about Mother Nature should be imparted wherever possible and take up practical step by each individual. I believe we still have the chance to save our Mother Nature, Science may bring some remedy but it cannot suffice for all especially us, who depend almost everything on agricultural and other natural means; it is not too late. I believe of a future where we will live an organic natural life, a life where nature is serving us at its best because we just took the simple step of preserving them. Let us nurture nature for a better future.","**Summary:** The writer emphasizes the urgent need to preserve and protect nature, highlighting the blessings of living in a rich, green environment with abundant resources and favorable climate. They advocate for eco-friendly lifestyles, responsible leadership, and environmental education, drawing inspiration from Bhutan's carbon-negative status. The message urges individuals to take practical steps toward conservation, believing it's not too late to restore balance and ensure a sustainable, organic future where nature and humanity thrive together.",Entertainment,2018-04-02 00:00:00

No difficulty in choosing CM in Haryana: Cong,"NEW DELHI: With the race for the chief minister''s post hotting up in Haryana as the Congress headed towards a landslide majority in the state, the party on Sunday said the newly elected legislators will clinch the issue. ""There will be no difficulty in choosing the chief minister. ""The elected legislators will meet and decide as to who would be the CM,"" Janardan Dwivedi, party general secretary in charge of Haryana, said. The claimants for the top post included old war horse and former chief minister Bhajan Lal, Birendra Singh, Bhupinder Singh Hooda and young turks Selja and Randeep Singh Surjewala. Asked about the public comments made by some of the leaders about their claim to the top post, Dwivedi said, ""We can contain their public utterances but not their aspirations. ""Anybody can aspire to become the chief minister. What we can tell them is not to behave in public in such a manner."" He said the trends in the counting of votes in the state had gone according to the expectations of the party and claimed that it was a vote for the party''s performance in other states and against the mis-rule of Om Prakash Chautala regime.","As the Congress secured a significant victory in Haryana, the party announced that the newly elected legislators would decide on the chief minister's post.

Appointment of Doctors Punjab makes heavy weather of selections,"Chandigarh, February 13 The simmering controversy over direct recruitment of doctors this year by the health department versus last year’s recruitment of doctors through the Punjab Public Service Commission escalated today with health department officials firmly denying any irregularity. The Punjab health department will tomorrow start distributing appointment letters to 214 doctors, selected directly by it, informed the department Secretary, Satish Chandra. He claimed that the government’s decision to go for direct recruitment had been vindicated because the department was yet to receive a single complaint related to the procedures followed. Several PPSC members, however, claim to have found the departmental process ‘vitiated’ and have threatened to drag the department to court. The controversy has erupted following a damning report submitted to the High Court by the state government’s Vigilance Bureau (see Page 5) indicting the PPSC for last year’s recruitment. The five PPSC members as well as its Chairman S K Sinha are being investigated by the Vigilance Bureau for “collusion” that led to alleged favourites being given higher marks in the interview to edge out more meritorious candidates in selection for 312 doctors last year. All of them are learnt to have joined last year itself but face a possible dismissal if the High Court holds the recruitment ‘vitiated’. Though PPSC members have picked holes in the selection process of the Punjab health department, it is a process that they might well have followed. The health department allocated 80 marks for a written test conducted by it and only 10 marks for the interview. The remaining 10 marks were equally divided with five marks earmarked for experience and five marks for having completed education in a rural area. Although a few candidates have secured higher marks in the written examination but fared badly in the interview, no objection has been received by the department, claimed sources. Chandra said each candidate was asked five questions, each of which carried two marks. He said the interview was video recorded and was available on demand. This is in sharp contrast to the casual manner in which the PPSC conducted interviews, which carried 50 marks with many candidates being asked only one or two questions and the interview allegedly getting over within minutes. Terming the selection by the PPSC as “doubtful”, the health secretary pointed out that in the system followed by the PPSC, those who scraped through their MBBS exam were given 18 points while toppers who secured over 70 per cent in their MBBS exam were awarded just 26 points. PPSC member Dr Satwant Singh Mohi, when contacted, said the prevailing system in the PPSC had been in place for the last 20 to 25 years. He claimed that Commission Chairman S K Sinha had actually “reformed” the system by splitting the 50 marks for the interview to 40 for the PPSC members and allocating the remaining 10 marks to the subject expert. “Earlier the subject expert could not award any mark at all,” he said. He also pointed out that the Commission had brought in subject experts from reputed institutions.","The controversy over direct recruitment of doctors by the Punjab health department has escalated, with officials denying any irregularity.

New CRZ laws ease shackles on building near coast,"The government has eased tough restrictions on construction activities along Mumbais coastline,and allowed redevelopment of slums and old,dilapidated buildings. The new Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) guidelines notified today gave concessions to fishing communities living along the coast,and provided for industrial activities that have necessarily to be located in the coastal regions. The new rules will replace the two-decade old CRZ Notification of 1991 that protects and regulates the use of land within 500 m of the coastline.

Consumer firms get an urban glow in Q2,"India’s packaged consumer goods companies reported robust urban growth in the September quarter, marked by a consumer preference for premium products, while demand in rural markets remained subdued. Earnings of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), the country’s largest household goods maker, underscored the resilience of urban markets despite the lingering effects of the pandemic. “We see a very resilient consumer when it comes to urban metros, higher income households, and there are high levels of growth across the board,” said Rohit Jawa, managing director and chief executive of HUL, in a post-earnings call with reporters on Thursday. “Markets are recovering, and it’s recovering faster in urban and lesser in rural.” HUL reported a 4% increase in profit in the September quarter, in line with analysts’ expectations. Standalone net profit climbed to ₹2,717 crore for the three months ended 30 September from ₹2,616 crore a year ago, the company said in a statement to the stock exchanges. Sales rose 4% to ₹15,027 crore from ₹14,514 crore in the year-ago period, while advertising and promotion spending increased 11.4% to ₹1,720 crore during the quarter. The company said it delivered a “resilient and competitive performance” in the quarter, with an underlying volume growth of 2%. Operating margin widened 130 basis points to 24.6% from a year earlier. HUL reported urban volume growth of approximately 10% this quarter, building on a 3% decline during the same period last year. But on a two-year basis, urban volume growth averaged 3%. Meanwhile, rural volume growth was at 7%. However, HUL said rural volume growth averaged -1% from a two-year perspective. HUL, however, expressed optimism about demand recovery, counting on the upcoming festive season, service sector growth and government-driven capital expenditure initiatives. Nonetheless, HUL is monitoring global commodity price fluctuations and the impact of monsoon patterns on crop output and reservoir levels. Urban markets showed growing demand for premium products. Premium categories, which previously comprised 25% of business, have now increased to nearly one-third, chief financial officer Ritesh Tiwari said. Meanwhile, Nestlé India, the country’s largest packaged foods company, has expanded its market reach to smaller towns and villages, an approach the company terms ‘rurban’, resulting in a 9.5% increase in total revenue for the quarter from a year earlier. Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director of Nestlé India, said domestic sales saw double-digit growth, led by key brands like Kitkat, Nescafe Classic and Nescafe Sunrise. However, Nestlé said it remains cautious as uneven rainfall and rain deficits could affect maize, sugar, oilseeds and spices production, stoking inflation. The Indian unit of the Swiss company posted a total revenue of ₹5,036.8 crore for the quarter, marking a 9.5% increase from ₹4,601.8 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. “Domestic sales grew in double digits on account of mix, volume and price. Key brands continued to perform well, led by Kitkat, Nescafe Classic, Nescafe Sunrise, supported by Munch and Milkmaid,” Narayanan said. “We crossed ₹5,000 crore turnover, which has been our first in any quarter in the history of the company and a landmark for us.” Domestic sales increased by 10% to ₹4,823.72 crore from a year earlier, while exports declined by 9.56% to ₹185.80 crore. Profit surged 37% to ₹908 crore in the quarter ended 30 September. Meanwhile, for ITC, the FMCG business (excluding cigarettes) reported an 8.3% increase in revenue in the quarter that ended 30 September to ₹5,291.60 crore, compared to ₹4,884.76 crore in the year-ago period, while the segment Ebitda was at ₹580.79 crore (from ₹463.20 crore in the year-ago period). All the FMCG companies have had to navigate high volatility in coffee prices due to global supply shortages. Nonetheless, Nestlé India anticipates a healthy milk flush during the winter, which should help stabilize milk prices.","In the September quarter, India's packaged consumer goods companies experienced robust growth in urban areas, with consumers showing a preference for premium products.

Magic mantra from fastest man ever: Do it for yourself,"2016, the Olympic Stadium at Rio de Janeiro. Usain Bolt smiles to himself and sways to a rhythm in his head, a little jig standing at the top of his lane, waiting for the 200m final to begin. His fellow runners look grimly determined, eyes narrowed, focus written deep on their faces. Bolt looks like he’s come to a party and met some good friends — no one could look more relaxed, languid. Who could have thought looking at him there that he was thinking of breaking his own, near-impossible world record, set in 2009? The starting gun fired and for a moment, the runners were shoulder to shoulder. Then, a familiar sight — for both his rivals and those watching — the fastest man on the planet, accelerating away without a care in the world, leaving the rest of the pack in a cluster behind him. Bolt won his eighth and final Olympic gold that night, embellishing a career that already dazzled like no other and completing a hat-trick of 100m-200m sprint doubles at the Olympics. Each of those medals were won with the flamboyance that defined him. Yet, it was not always so. Bolt, too, had to struggle through the pressure of expectations and the nervousness of performing, before working out how to overcome those burdens. Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Bolt said that he developed a mantra: “Put myself first.” “At a young age, I was very nervous,” he said. “At the World Juniors, in Jamaica, the 200m finals, I was so nervous I put the wrong shoe on the wrong foot. And I still won! I thought, if I can do this in front of my home crowd, with the wrong shoe, maybe I could win anywhere.” He was 15 at that time, and the attention that came with winning the event came as a “shock”. “At 15, to be known in my country, people coming up to me asking for pictures, autographs, was a shock,” he said in a session moderated by senior sports journalist Ayaz Memon. “I worried about whether I’ll let my country down, let my family down… “And then I told myself, you know what, how can I not let myself down? How can I be true to who I am? I figured out that I wanted to do this for myself.” He was acutely aware of how much people expected from him, how they believed that he would take his junior triumph and turn it into immediate success at the senior level as soon as he was of age. But it didn’t work out that way. “But it took me a long time to figure it out,” Bolt said. “People started saying ‘oh he was good as a junior but he won’t make it at the senior level’. But I focused on me, I said I won’t listen to the world but I’ll work on myself.” On himself, but not by himself. Bolt was lucky to be surrounded by people who believed in him and were there for him—his closest friends, his coach and his masseuse. “We went on a journey together, they were there with me from before I started winning,” Bolt said. “I keep the same set of people around me.” Yet, as he lined up at the 2007 World Championships, he was not quite there, not quite the man who would set world records that will be deemed unbreakable. In the race, he finished second in the 200m behind American sprinter Tyson Gay. “I went to my coach and said, ‘I was injury free, I was feeling good, and I ran like never before, but how do I get better?’” Bolt said. “He said, do this, this and this and you’ll be the best. And I did all of those things.” The next year, Bolt hit his peak and he never came off it till his retirement in 2017. The man who started running for himself was so unrivalled, he only had himself to compete with.","Usain Bolt, widely regarded as one of the greatest sprinters in the history of athletics, shared insights into his mindset and journey to success at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit. Bolt revealed that he initially struggled with nervousness and pressure, especially as expectations grew after his success as a junior athlete. However, he developed a mantra of ""putting himself first"" and focused on staying true to who he was. Bolt emphasized the importance of having a supportive team and revealed that he sought advice from his coach to improve further after finishing second in the 200m at the 2007 World Championships. Following that, Bolt went on to achieve unprecedented success, including multiple Olympic gold medals and world records.",International News,2021-12-01 00:00:00
"AI stir off, but wait for flights to get normal","An assurance by Union Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel to agitating Air India executive pilots that there would be no cut in their incentives, it appears, struck right on target as the protesters called off their five days old stir today morning. But, flight normalcy may be restored only from tomorrow. The airline’s management said the pilots would be assigned work once they were declared fit to fly. While domestic flights would return to schedule in a phased manner, international flights were expected to resume by tomorrow night. Interestingly, the drama surrounding the stir continued till the very last minute of the 5 pm deadline set by Patel for the pilots to report back to work. While during the day only a few pilots reported for duty, but as the deadline neared around 100 more announced they were ready to fly. Notably, the government had warned of disciplinary action in case the pilots had not reported to work by 5 pm. With Air India CMD Arvind Jadhav unable to resolve the crisis at his level, in the end it took the government at the level of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to ensure that normalcy prevailed in the national carrier. Truce was forced when the PMO intervened and asked Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel to resolve the matter at the earliest. While seemingly it was Patel’s “appeal” and an “assurance” to pilots that played the trick, actually some hard talk led to the stalemate being resolved. At the end of the stand-off, leader of agitating pilots, VK Bhalla, hailed the Prime Minister for “intervening” and the Civil Aviation Minister for his “assurance” of a status quo on the salary front. “As the Aviation Minister has officially assured us, we are calling off the strike with immediate effect,” Bhalla said. The Civil Aviation Minister also thanked the pilots for calling off their agitation. “The Air India CMD will be shortly forming a committee of executive pilots,” Patel said at the end of the impasse that led to hundreds of domestic and international flights being cancelled. Sources, however, said pilots were given a clear message that they would face disciplinary action, even revocation of licence and sacking of their “leaders”, if they did not fall in line by 5 pm today. With the aviation sector going through a massive downturn worldwide, there were not enough flying jobs available anymore. And who knows it better than the Minister, who said: “There are no avenues of employment elsewhere. It is still better in India because the spirit here is not anti-employee.” The fact is there are anywhere between 3,000 to 3,500 commercial pilot licence (CPL) holders looking for jobs. Nearly 100 to 150 young CPL holders, who spent anywhere up to Rs 35 lakh to become pilots, had recently formed the All India Unemployed Pilots Association (UPA). The strike may be over for the time being but the crisis in the cash-strapped national carrier is far from over. Air India is expected to get around Rs 5,000 crore infusion linked to the rider that it will cut costs to the tune of Rs 630 crore. The airline's losses since last fiscal till recently are expected to be over Rs 7,200 crore. Patel asked the national carrier to take steps to reduce its expenses and debts and warned that the government's support for Air India did not come without a rider. Meanwhile, Bhalla said: “The profitability is directly related to fuel factor. We know how to save fuel that will generate profit. We will advise the top management to stop wasteful expenditure, like a golf tournament is being sponsored by Air India.”","Air India's pilots have called off their five-day strike, after assurances from Union Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel that there would be no cut in their incentives.

Avengers Vs Avatar,"Bangalore: The Bangalore head-turner turned out to be a head-bump designed to give a headache to the principal opponent on the other side as well as potential challengers on the same side. Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday greeted Mayawati with an affectionate head-bump, sending ripples that are likely to eddy past the Opposition platform in the south and reach northern states where the last skirmishes before the 2019 election will be fought. The bonhomie between Sonia and Mayawati became the most striking feature of the ceremony where H.D. Kumaraswamy was sworn in as Karnataka chief minister. Sonia repeatedly held Mayawati's hand. The BSP leader, barely known for public display of emotion, threw her arm around Sonia and laughed merrily. Although the two leaders had developed a strong personal bond over the past year, the public show of intimacy in Bangalore injected an element of the unexpected - and needless to say - conjectures. Some felt Sonia had gone out of the way to flash a political message of ""togetherness"" as the Dalit leader is expected to play a crucial role in the 2019 general election as well as the preceding Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Little stops Narendra Modi from retaining power if he repeats his performance in Uttar Pradesh. Such a surge can be upset by Mayawati alone by sustaining the BSP's alliance with the Samajwadi Party. Only Rahul Gandhi was supposed to attend the swearing-in ceremony on behalf of the Congress central leadership but Sonia decided to go to ensure that the picture of Opposition unity looked complete and no glitches cropped up. Although Rahul has been trying to establish a rapport with Opposition leaders, age often stands in the way of developing a natural connect with the veterans. The chemistry among Rahul, the SP's Akhilesh Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav of the RJD has worked out well but the Congress president is yet to win the trust of the old guard of Indian politics. Some sources felt Sonia might also have sent a subtle message to leaders like Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Telangana chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao who have been pitching for a separate political front not led by the Congress. In Bangalore, Mamata, who appeared to have been miffed with traffic arrangements as a snarl made her walk, stressed on the need to strengthen regional forces. If Sonia succeeds in luring away Mayawati, Akhilesh and Tejashwi, the Congress can render the third front purposeless. In this endeavour, the political realities of Maharashtra help the Congress as Sharad Pawar's NCP cannot hope to become a significant player without a prop. Sonia did speak to Mamata and others but the manner of interaction appeared to have been carefully crafted. Whether political signals were sent or not, the on-stage chemistry among different leaders reflected a willingness to bury individual egos. When Mamata and CPM leader Sitaram Yechury came across each other for a fleeting moment, they shook hands.","Sonia Gandhi's public display of intimacy in Bangalore during the swearing-in ceremony for H.D.

Some sources believe that Sonia may have sent a subtle message to leaders like Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Telangana chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao, who have been pitching for a separate political front not led by the Congress. If Sonia succeeds in luring away Mayawati, Akhilesh, and Tejashwi, the Congress can render the third front purposeless, benefiting the political realities of Maharashtra.",Politics,2018-05-24 00:00:00
Activists hanker after more,"NEW DELHI: The cabinet decision may have attempted to disable the Right to Information Act but that has not stopped activist Aruna Roy from using the same legislation to pack in a punch. She has requested the cabinet secretariat for details based on which the cabinet decided- to omit file notings except those related to social and developmental projects- from the purview of the RTI act. In an application filed with the cabinet secretariat on Monday, Roy has asked for ""the decisions of the council of ministers, the reasons thereof, and the material on the basis of which the decisions were taken, relating to amendments to be made in the Right to Information Act of 2005."" The controversial decision- to allow file notings related only to social and developmental work to be made public-has stirred a hornet's nest. While social activists have described the move to tinker with a legislation that has been enforced for less than a year, the government has tried to paint the move as a progressive one. File notings have become such a point of debate because of their importance. It is these notes that hold the rationale for government actions, or the lack of it, change in certain policy, why a certain contract is given or why a sanction was withheld to prosecute a particular corrupt official. Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan's Nikhil Dey said that the bureaucrats were ke-en on removing file notings, especially those relating to personnel related matters, from the view of the public. ""It is a well-known fact that postings and appointments in the government are done mainly on the basis of patronage and influence. Those who preside over the RTI act do not want to lose this power of patronage and start becoming answerable for their actions,"" Dey said. He added that despite public statements to the contrary, government did not want to give up its privilege to continue functioning ""arbitrarily and secretively."" The government on the other hand has been caught on the backfoot.At pains to prove that the amendment was not a case of regression the PMO insisted that ""only a small portion of file notings will now remain exempted from disclosure. This is related to subjects that are already exempted under sub-Section (1) of Section 8 of the Act and to personnel-related matters like examination, assessment and evaluation for recruitment, disciplinary proceedings.","Activist Aruna Roy utilizes the Right to Information Act to challenge the cabinet's decision to exclude certain file notings from RTI purview. The move sparks controversy, with activists criticizing it as regressive and the government defending it as progressive, citing exemptions related to personnel matters and specific subjects.",GOVT POLICIES,2006-08-01 00:00:00

‘Young people more likely to survive Ebola’,"AP SPAIN: Who survives Ebola and why? Health workers treating patients in Sierra Leone, including some who died doing that work, have published the most detailed report yet on medical aspects of the epidemic. The research suggests young people are less likely to perish, fever is the most common symptom when victims first seek care, and early help is crucial. The report, published online Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine, is from 47 doctors, nurses and others who cared for 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone, one of the West African countries hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic. Their work adds new knowledge about the disease, which has killed more than 5,000 since early this year, the largest outbreak ever of Ebola, said one study leader, Dr. John Schieffelin, an infectious diseases specialist from Tulane University School of Medicine. In particular, it shows the advantage of youth – the fatality rate was only 57 percent for patients under 21, but a whopping 94 percent for those over 45. “They’re more resilient and younger and tougher,” Schieffelin said. “This is definitely the most detailed analysis” of symptoms and factors related to survival, he added. One striking factor was how devastating the severe diarrhea is from the disease. “It requires a lot of intensive fluid therapy,” and replacement of body salts called electrolytes, to help people survive, he said. It can be hard even in an outbreak setting to tell who has Ebola. Of the 213 people initially tested for signs of a hemorrhagic fever, about half, or 106, turned out to have Ebola. The estimated incubation period was 6 to 12 days, similar to what has been seen elsewhere in this outbreak. Fever was the most common symptom – 89 percent had it when diagnosed. Other symptoms were headache (80 percent), weakness (66 percent), dizziness (60 percent), diarrhea (51 percent), abdominal pain (40 percent), and vomiting (34 percent). Only one patient had bleeding, one of the most gruesome symptoms, but researchers say other cases may have been missed through incomplete record-keeping. Patients with weakness, dizziness and diarrhea were more likely to die. Those with more virus in their blood when they sought medical care, indicating more advanced infections, were more likely to die than those who got help when their illness was less far along. Seven of the 47 study authors died – six of them from Ebola and one from a stroke. They included Dr Sheik Humarr Khan, a doctor who led Sierra Leone’s battle against Ebola until his death in July.","Health workers treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, one of the hardest-hit West African countries, have published a detailed report on medical aspects of the epidemic.

John Abraham's next with Rohit Shetty based on former Mumbai Police Commissioner? - Details Inside,"John Abraham and Rohit Shetty are all set to team up for a powerful new project that blends real-life drama with the director’s signature action-packed storytelling. As per the latest reports, this untitled film is inspired by the life and career of former Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria. Inspired by a true life story As reported by Mid-Day, the film draws its inspiration from Maria’s autobiography, ‘Let Me Say It Now’, and is set to chronicle his journey from being a young boy from Bandra to becoming one of the most respected cops in India. The script reads like a thriller, with intense moments from some of Mumbai’s darkest chapters – including the 1993 Bombay blasts and the 26/11 terror attacks. The report revealed that the film would follow his journey and focus on his deep connection with Mumbai and the vital role he played in safeguarding the city during the terror attacks. John Abraham defends 'The Diplomat' after ban in the Middle East: ‘Not an anti-Pakistan film’ A truth-driven cop Universe from Rohit ShettyKnown for his gripping and glossy cop dramas like 'Singham', 'Simmba', and 'Sooryavanshi', Rohit is now taking a different route. This time, the drama is grounded in real-life events. As an insider told the portal, “Rohit always wanted to make a cop film rooted in truth. Rakesh Maria’s life reads like a thriller. It’s intense and has many high points, from his investigation of the 1993 Bombay blasts and the 26/11 attacks to his brush with the underworld. Maria and Shetty have been in talks for a while, and it’s finally starting now.” The first leg of the shoot will focus on Maria’s early days in the police force. A dedicated team of about 150 crew members, including prosthetic specialists, research teams, and action coordinators, will be on set to ensure authenticity in storytelling and aesthetics. The team is even constructing a detailed set of the Maharashtra ATS headquarters, which played a pivotal role in Maria’s real-life story. Shetty’s crew has planned to shoot at nearly 40 real locations across Mumbai. These include culturally and historically significant sites like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Dongri, and the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel – all places connected in some way to events from Maria’s tenure.","John Abraham and Rohit Shetty are collaborating on a new action-packed film based on the real-life story of former Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria.

Afzal Guru was hanged for eight minutes,"Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru was hanged at 8am on Saturday in front of eight people in the Tihar Jail in a procedure that took eight minutes, prison sources said on Saturday. They told IANS that Guru was informed about his hanging late Friday evening after a death warrant was issued by a Delhi court. “He was told about his hanging yesterday (Friday) by the jailor,” a source said. The source said Guru was hanged about 20 metres from his cell where he spent 12 years in solitary confinement. “There were eight people, including a doctor, a magistrate and some jail officials, present when he was hanged. He was hanged for eight minutes,” the source told IANS. Guru was buried quietly soon after the hanging. After he was woken up at 5am, he offered prayers before calmly approaching the noose, officials said. A Muslim cleric was also present during his hanging. Guru was convicted for his role in plotting the December 13, 2001, attack on Parliament House, in which 10 people were killed when five armed terrorists stormed into the complex when 100 MPs, then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his cabinet ministers were inside.","Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru was hanged at 8am on Saturday in front of eight people in the Tihar Jail.

Coral Reef in Mexico to get its own insurance policy,"A stretch of coral reef off Mexico is the testing ground for a new idea that could protect fragile environments around the world: insurance.The reef, off the coast of Cancún, is the first to be protected under an insurance scheme by which the premiums will be paid by local hotels and government, and money to pay for the repair of the reef will be released if a storm strikes.Coral reefs offer a valuable buffer against storm damage from waves but their condition has deteriorated in recent years, the result of human exploitation and destruction of the reefs, as well as climate change, plastic waste and the acidification of the oceans.Under the Cancún insurance policy, pioneered by the insurance company Swiss Re and the Nature Conservancy, a US environmental charity, local organisations dependent on tourism will pay in to a collective pot likely to amount to between $1m (£770,000) and $7.5m for the insurance premiums on the policy, and a 40 mile (60km) stretch of reef and connected beach will be monitored. If any destructive storms damage the reef system, the insurer will pay out sums likely to be $25m to $70m in any given year.Any payouts will be used for restoration of the reef, for instance by building artificial structures that can increase the height of the reef in case of storm damage.Corals from the reef can be removed and rested for a period of weeks or months, to help them regrow, at which point they can be safely reattached to their native habitat to regenerate the growth of the reef system. The advantages of such restoration go far beyond the hotels that border the seafront. As well as providing a natural brake against destructive storms, coral reefs provide nurseries for fish when they are growing, and form a vital part of the marine ecosystem. Their health or decline is seen as one of the key indicators of the state of the natural environment globally.The Cancún scheme, which is to be run by Swiss Re and the Nature Conservancy, with backing from the Mexican government, is thought to be one of the first in the world to tie environmental benefits and the ?eco-system services? provided by natural environmental features to firm monetary costs and rewards. It could provide a model for similar projects in the future, linking the protection and preservation of the environment to payouts in case of disaster.Hotels and private companies are signing up to the scheme at present, and the plan is for a fund backed by the government that will cover the premiums. This is scheduled to be activated in September, with further contracts to be signed in November and December, and full coverage will then begin from next January.?Public-private partnerships are the key,? said Mark Tercek, chief executive of the Nature Conservancy, in an interview with the Guardian. He predicted that more governments would see the advantages of such an approach when the Cancún scheme begins formal operation.?I used to get very frustrated that not enough was happening [to protect the environment],? said Tercek. ?We have to push business leaders to go further, to stick their neck out to tackle issues beyond the short term.?Tercek said the Cancún scheme would provide an example for businesses, governments and insurance firms that would be ?very scalable around the world?.A future target for similar insurance products could be mangrove swamps, which also protect the shore against storm damage, and are equally under threat, with many destroyed to make way for housing development or farming, and others in peril from climate change.","Insurance giant Swiss Re is preparing an insurance policy for the Mesoamerican Reef in Mexico to prevent its further deterioration, reports said. Under the scheme, which is reportedly the first for a natural structure, the premiums will be paid by hotels and government, and money to pay for the repair of the reef will be released if a storm strikes.n",Local News,2023-11-07 00:00:00

Kaur scored a 66-ball 63 in the fifth and final ODI against New Zealand recently to roar back into form, the knock helping India to avoid a whitewash at the hands of the home team. Raj and star opener Smriti Mandhana, who scored 73 in the final ODI, maintained their second and eight spots respectively. All-rounder Deepti Sharma also saw her position improve in the bowling charts, gaining one spot up to No.12. She returned with figures of 1/49 in four overs and 2/42 in 10 overs in the fourth and fifth ODIs respectively. She only scored nine runs in the fourth ODI and did not bat in the fifth match, which saw her lose one spot in the all-rounders' rankings, down to No.5. Veteran pacer Jhulan Goswami continued to be the only Indian in the top 10, as she held on to her fourth spot in the bowlers' chart. New Zealand's Amelia Kerr did very well in the final two ODIs of the five-match series against India. In the fourth ODI, which was reduced to a 20-over contest, Kerr scored an unbeaten 68 in only 33 deliveries. In the fifth and final ODI, Kerr scored 68 in 75 balls. Her exploits with the bat have seen her jump up five spots to No.17 in the rankings chart for batters. Kerr also contributed with a few handy overs in the final two matches. In the fourth match, she returned with figures of 3/30 in 3.5 overs as New Zealand successfully defended a score of 191. In the fifth and final ODI, she registered figures of 1/55 in her 10 overs. This has seen her rankings rise up to No.17 in bowlers, a gain of four positions. She has also broken into the top 5 of the all-rounders' chart, gaining two positions up to No.4. Her form will undoubtedly aid New Zealand as the hosts aim to clinch their second ICC Women's Cricket World Cup title, beginning March 4. In other big movements, Amy Satterthwaite dropped down four positions in the batting rankings, down to No.7. She scored a 16-ball 32 in the fourth ODI and 21-ball 12 in the fifth and final contest.

Chronology of communal violence in India,"India witnessed its worst communal riots in 1948 after the partition. Noakhali in Bengal and several villages of Bihar were the worst hit. One of the first major communal riots took place in August 1893 in Mumbai in which about a hundred people were killed and 800 injured. The period between 1921 and 1940 marked a particularly difficult phase. The 1926 Muharram celebrations in Calcutta were for example marred by a clash that led to 28 deaths.Unlock exclusive access to the latest news on India's general elections, only on the HT App. Download Now! Download Now! India witnessed its worst communal riots in 1948 after the partition. Noakhali in Bengal and several villages of Bihar were the worst hit. The first major riots between Hindus and Muslims after the bloodshed of partition in 1947 occurred in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh in 1961. 1969 Ahmedabad riots: Communal riots between Hindus and Muslims erupted in Ahmedabad in 1969. Atleast 1000 people had died during this riot. At the time there was a dispute over the leadership of the Congress party between Indira Gandhi and Morarji Desai. There were suggestions that violence was deliberately engineered to discredit the chief minister of Gujarat who was a supporter of Mr Desai. Hindu-Muslim riots broke out in Jamshedpur and Aligarh in 1979 and in Moradabad in 1980. 1984 sikh riots: The assassination of prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 sparked riots that lasted 15 days. Several inquiry panels later, eight people were convicted. The politicians and police got away. The mayhem began at about 6 p.m. shortly after the death of Indira Gandhi was announced at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. The news set the tone for a communal massacre that India hadn't quite witnessed since Independence. Chaos reigned on the streets and locality after locality in the capital echoed with the shrieks of the dying and burning people. A fortnight of carnage saw over 2,700 dead and many thousands injured. ""President Zail Singh wanted the army to act, but it didn't. The then prime minister and home minister did not take his calls,"" recalls Tarlochan Singh, who was Zail Singh's press secretary The worst affected areas were the ones that had elected Congressmen HKL Bhagat and Sajjan Kumar to the Lok Sabha. Yet the police could do nothing to lay their hands on them. 1987 Merrut riots: The riots began on May 21, 1987 and continued for two months. The state police conducted a probe but all cases were later withdrawn by the state. The armed personnel accused went scot free. As with most riots, there are conflicting versions on what set this one off: burning of mills or a reaction to the carnage by the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) personnel. A majority claim it was the armed police. The PAC men wanted to arrest a man from the Hashimpura area but were stopped by a mob. When the uniformed men tried to force their way in, the crowd became violent. The PAC called in reinforcements and retaliated instantly. About 40 bodies were later found floating in the canal near Maliana village. This ignited communal passions and Meerut was soon on fire. Within hours, over 350 shops in the city and three petrol pumps had been burnt. In the following two months, 350 people were killed, among them prominent residents including a doctor from Hapur and an army captain. Rationality took the backseat as one set of residents instigated massacres against another. It took several weeks for a 13,000-strong army detachment to restore peace in Meerut. The Uttar Pradesh government, under pressure from the Rajiv Gandhi government, withdrew hundreds of cases from district courts in Meerut. As a result, there were no convictions. The PAC, having terrorised a large section of Meerut, was the biggest gainer-and justice the biggest loser.1989 Bhagalpur riots: On October 23, 1989 began the month-long riots triggered by police atrocities. Of the 864 cases filed by the police, 535 were closed and most accused acquitted for lack of evidence. Following police atrocities in 1989, the silk city of Bhagalpur saw massacre and arson in which over 1,000 people died, nearly 50,000 were displaced and 11,500 houses torched. In the carnage, an army major herded 100 men, women and children to a house at Chanderi village and posted the local police for their protection. The next morning, however, he found the house empty. Four days later, 61 mutilated bodies were found in a nearby pond, among them a live Malika Bano whose right leg had been chopped off. Bano narrated a story that continues to haunt Bhagalpur. On the night of October 27, a frenzied mob took over the house from the police, slaughtered the people hiding inside and tossed their bodies in the pond. Of the 864 cases registered by the Bihar Police, chargesheets were filed in only 329 cases. In 100 of these, the accused were acquitted for want of evidence. Chanderi was no different. Of the 38 accused, only 16 were convicted and sentenced to rigorous life terms, while 22 were acquitted. The Babri masjid demolition set off riots between December 1992 and January 1993. The Sri Krishna panel examined 502 witnesses, but no police officer has yet been punished.1992 Mumbai riots: Hours after the demolition of the Babri masjid, Mumbai erupted. For five days in December 1992 and then again for a fortnight in January, the city witnessed unprecedented riots. As many as 1,788 people were killed and property worth crores of rupees destroyed. On January 25, 1993, the Maharashtra government set up the Sri Krishna Commission of Inquiry, which recorded the evidence of 502 witnesses and examined 2,903 exhibits. But three years later, on January 23, 1996, the BJP-Shiv Sena government wound up the commission, only to reinstate it later under public pressure. The commission finally submitted its report on February 16, 1998. Of the 17 police officers who were formally charged in mid-2001, not one has been arrested so far. Even departmental action has not been initiated against them. In April this year, former city police commissioner RD Tyagi and eight serving police officers accused of killing nine people, were discharged by a Mumbai sessions court. 2002 Gujarat riots: On February 27, 2002 suspected Muslim mob attacked a train carrying activists of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) back from the disputed holy site of Ayodhya. The attack left 58 Hindu activists dead. The episode resulted in major riots, which left many Mulims dead in Gujarat","India has a history of severe communal riots, starting with the 1893 Mumbai riots. Major incidents include the 1948 Noakhali and Bihar riots post-partition, the 1961 Jabalpur riots, and the 1969 Ahmedabad riots, which killed around 1,000 people. The 1984 anti-Sikh riots followed Indira Gandhi’s assassination, resulting in 2,700 deaths. The 1987 Meerut riots saw 350 killed, and the 1989 Bhagalpur riots caused over 1,000 deaths. The Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 triggered the Mumbai riots, killing 1,788.

"As Shramik Specials reach Bihar, corporate houses lend helping hand with meals, sanitiser kiosks","As migrant workers make their way home on Shramik Special trains, several corporate giants have stepped in to provide them with refreshments and other requirements. With supply chains stressed due to the lockdown, sourcing packed food to distribute in trains has become a challenge in places like Bihar. Thus, officials have established direct connect with corporate majors, and several business houses are helping, under their Corporate Social Responsibility initiative. On Monday for instance, the Coca-Cola Company sponsored one lakh bottles of its aerated soft drinks and juices for passengers on Shramik Specials arriving in or passing through Bihar. Soft drink bottles worth Rs 80 lakh donated by Coca Cola were distributed at the Danapur Division in Patna. Officials said surprised passengers preferred the soft drinks first over the hot meals being served. Danapur, the first main stop after crossing Mughalsarai, serves trains to Northeast and North Bengal, as well as to several locations in Bihar. Bihar has so far received 1,482 trains, while at least 65 have gone to the Northeast. Almost all of them have had pit stops at Danapur. The snacks were provided over and above the freshly cooked meals, like biryani, served in all trains. FMCG major ITC contributed packaged snacks, biscuits and such items worth Rs 25 lakh, along with water bottles to make â€œration kitsâ€ for each migrant, especially on trains going to Northeast. Hindustan Unilever was roped in to install COVID-19 safe foot-operated sanitisation kiosks at multiple places, and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) held online courses for station staff on safe food handling vis-Ã -vis COVID-19. Crompton Greavs provided 25 industrial-level sprayers for sanitisation, utilised on all the big stations in the division. Along with sourcing meals, distributing them to a huge number of passengers was also a challenge. To meet this, Divisonal Railway Manager Sunil Kumar, and his team led by Senior Divisional Commercial Manager Aadhar Raj, devised a system of signing up volunteers from the Railway fraternity. â€œThe trains going to North Bengal, Assam and other Northeast states are coming to us from places as far-off as Goa and Maharashtra. They still have a good 12-hour journey left when they cross us. So a meal service and ration kit to each passenger was important. For manpower, we signed up volunteers who helped distribute the food and water. To these trains, we had to ensure passengers had eatables to consume twice,â€ said a senior official of the Danapur division. As many as 500 railway functionaries signed up to be volunteers. Many went to smaller stations like Kiul and Jhajha along with medium-sized stations like Arrah and Buxar. Seeing that several passengers were social media savvy - as they kept tagging the divisionâ€™s social media handle with requests - railway officials started publicising a WhatsApp number on which passengers of incoming trains could update their current locations live, to give officials a realistic idea about when to expect the train. This feature came in handy when trains were diverted due to congestion. Across India, Railways has distributed at least 1.19 crore meals and over 1.5 crore bottles of water.","With supply chains hit due to the lockdown, government officials contacted corporates to help provide food and water to the migrants, and several stepped up.",Human Interest,2020-06-02 00:00:00
"After demolitions by HYDRAA officials, criminal cases filed against builders for encroachments","After a series of demolitions of properties built on lake beds and in buffer zones, the State government is now registering criminal cases against the builders who encroached the lakes. The Bachupally police booked managing partner of Maps Infra, P. Sudhakar Reddy, for illegal construction within the Full Tank Level (FTL) level of Errakunta in Nizampet, a government land which was inspected by Hyderabad Disaster Response and Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA) officials on August 14. A case was booked and investigation was initiated following a complaint from the Irrigation department on August 20. According to the complaint, Maps Infra had obtained permission from Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) to construct residential buildings in Bachupally village. However, upon inspection by the Irrigation officials, it was found that the ongoing construction was falling in the survey number 134, government land notified as Errakunta. The Irrigation department had previously requested revenue officials to demarcate the area to verify if the construction fell within the FTL/buffer of the lake. The demarcation, conducted in March 2024, confirmed the encroachment. The complaint also alleges that the company had earlier constructed sheds in the same area, which were demolished by the authorities. The complainant has requested legal action against the company and a halt to further construction activity on the government land. A case was also booked against builders D. Swarnlatha and D. Krishna Kishore by the Miyapur police for three unauthorised constructions in the buffer zone of Erla Cheruvu, in Madinaguda of Hyderabad. The action followed a complaint from the Irrigation department on August 18, highlighting the illegal constructions in survey number 25 in Vaishali Nagar. The complaint identified D. Swarnalatha and D. Krishna Kishore as the builders responsible for unauthorised structures on plots 148, 149, and 150 respectively. According to the Gover- nment Order (G.O Ms.No. 168, MA &UD Dept., Dt: 07.04.2012), any construction within the buffer zone of water bodies is strictly prohibited. The complaint further stated that these constructions not only violated the law but also caused potential harm by obstructing the natural flow of water and causing loss to government land.

"Lawyers want RBI to plug gap, block foreign companies’ entry","MUMBAI: Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) has asked the government to direct the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to plug what it called a loophole in its March 29 directive “which may lead to the backdoor entry of foreign law firms in India.” The lawyers’ body is of the view that the RBI’s direction, as well as an amendment to Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Rules in India, could be used by foreign law firms. In a letter to the Prime Minister on July 29, the BCD said the central bank’s March 29 directive said that for the establishment of the branch office, liaison office, project office or any other place of business in India, foreign entities rendering professional or consultancy services can operate after the RBI grants them an approval under the Foreign Exchange Management and Regulation Act. “We have serious objection to the decision to permit foreign law firms in Special Economic Zones (SEZ) area in India unilaterally without the concurrence of the parent body entrusted with the responsibility of the legal profession in India,” said the BCD in its fourpage letter. “The decision to permit foreign law firms to open an office in the SEZ area in India, being highly arbitrary, is uncalled for and contrary to the interest of the legal fraternity in India has wider implications.” On January 3, 2017, the government brought an amendment in the SEZ Rules which allowed foreign legal and accountancy services to operate from SEZs. “In the Special Economic Zones Rules, 2006, in Rule 76, for the words ‘professional services (excluding legal services and accounting) rental/leasing services without operators’, the words ‘professional services, rental/leasing services without operators’ shall be substituted,” said the amendment. “We want the government to direct the RBI to withdraw the ‘Master Directions’ and also the amendment of rule 76 of SEZ Rules in so far as they relate to the legal profession directly or indirectly,” said KC Mittal, chairman of the BCD. The BCD has also directed the Big Four audit and consulting firms not to offer legal services in India. In May, BCD had directed lawyers affiliated with KPMG, Price WaterhouseCoopers (PWC), EY and Deloitte India to refrain from practising law until further order. BCD took up the complaint filed by the apex body of the law firms, Society of Indian Law Firms (SILF) against major audit and accounting firms practising law. Now, the BCD is expected to hear the matter further on August 23.","The Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) has urged the government to instruct the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to close a loophole in a March 29 directive that could allow foreign law firms to operate in India. The directive permits foreign entities offering professional or consultancy services to establish business offices in India with RBI approval. BCD's July 29 letter to the Prime Minister contends that this, along with an amendment to Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Rules, could enable foreign law firms to enter India, which BCD claims is against the interests of Indian legal professionals. The BCD demands the withdrawal of both the RBI directive and the SEZ rule amendment and has also prohibited the Big Four audit firms from providing legal services in India. The issue, prompted by a complaint from the Society of Indian Law Firms (SILF), will be further addressed on August 23.",Crime and Justice,2019-08-03 00:00:00

"Pak to get F16s, Bush tells PM Offers co-production of higher model to India","New Delhi, March 25 In a balancing act, United States President George W Bush telephoned Prime Minister Manmohan Singh this evening to convey that Washington had cleared the sale of F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan. Dr Manmohan Singh conveyed India’s concern about the US decision to sell F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan, saying it would adversely affect the security situation in the subcontinent, PM’s Media Advisor Sanjay Baru told this correspondent. Mr Bush’s call to the PM was made at 7.15 p.m. Indian concerns about delivery of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan can be better understood if one appreciates the fact that F-16 are nuclear-capable aircraft. In other words, F-16s can drop nuclear payload on a number of Indian cities. Top sources in the government told The Tribune that though the US had decided to sell F-16s to Pakistan, it had offered “much more” to India, including civilian nuclear technology. Sources said the US had also advised all its defence manufacturers to sell to India whatever equipment it desired to sell. Secondly, the US is understood to have offered to India a “top-of-the-line” model of F-16, a plane which is several notches above the F-16 that is being sold to Pakistan An important distinction here is that the US is offering to Pakistan F-16s on “Take-and-fly-away” basis, it had offered India licensed production of F-16s in India. The Us agreeing to licensed production in another country is rarity. Third and last, the US has offered to sell to India civilian nuclear technology, something about which Washington is extremely careful. This may lead to the US selling India a NUCLEAR REACTOR, which will be nothing short of a miracle considering the state of Indo-US relations in the past 58 years. A top source said the nuclear reactor from America was “an ultimate thing” and remarked that one did not need to be bothered about the F-16s because the planes had been offered to both India and Pakistan in terms of the size of the countries and their economies.","U.S. President George W. Bush called Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to inform him of Washington’s decision to sell F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan. Dr. Singh expressed India’s strong concerns, highlighting the aircraft's nuclear capability and its impact on regional security. In an apparent balancing act, the U.S. offered India advanced military hardware, licensed F-16 production, and, significantly, civilian nuclear technology. This includes the potential sale of a U.S. nuclear reactor to India — a notable shift in Indo-U.S. relations. The U.S. also promised to allow American defence firms to sell India equipment of its choosing.",International News,2005-03-26 00:00:00
Caution warranted for river-linking project,"Is the proposed interlinking of rivers a bold and ambitious engineering project that will resolve the country’s water woes or is it an ill-conceived plan built on obsolete ideas that will devastate the country’s riverine ecosystems? Even as the government claims to have made significant progress with the initial clearances and negotiations so as to kick-start the project, which has been in the pipeline for several decades, expert opinion on the matter remains as sharply divided as ever. To be fair, this is to be expected, given the sheer scale and scope of the project: 30 river linkages and more than 3,000 storage structures spread across a 15,000km canal network that will transfer 174 trillion litres of water every year, and will cost a total of Rs5.6 trillion. This puts the river-linking project on a par with some of the most daring feats of engineering attempted in the history of mankind. It is a reimagining of the entire aquatic ecosystem of a country as large and diverse as India. That said, the basic idea driving the project is actually fairly simple: Connect the Himalayan and peninsular rivers via a network of canals so that excess water from one channel can be diverted to another which has inadequate flow. Proponents of the project, which include successive governments at the Centre, argue that river linking offers three key benefits: It will irrigate about 87 million acres of farmland, control floods, and generate 34 GW of hydroelectric power. These are tantalizing prospects: India’s rain-fed farms are forever hostage to the vagaries of nature, so much so that even one bad monsoon has a direct and debilitating economic impact. At the same time, simultaneous floods and droughts in different parts of the country continue to wreak havoc, destroying the lives and livelihoods of millions. India also desperately needs clean energy to fuel its development processes, and if river water can be leveraged and redirected to serve these purposes, that’s an option worth exploring.","The proposed interlinking of rivers in India has sparked a debate between supporters and critics regarding its potential benefits and drawbacks. Proponents argue that the project could address key issues such as irrigation, flood control, and hydroelectric power generation. They believe that linking rivers could benefit millions of acres of farmland, mitigate the impact of floods, and provide much-needed clean energy. However, critics raise concerns about the environmental impact and feasibility of the project, citing potential disruptions to river ecosystems and the massive cost involved. The project's scale and ambition make it one of the most daring engineering endeavors in history, but its implementation remains contentious amidst divided expert opinions.",Environment,2017-09-07 00:00:00
KEA Bluetooth scam will not be entrusted to CBI: Priyank Kharge,"The Police Department is thoroughly investigating the KEA Bluetooth scam in which some candidates used Bluetooth devices for writing examinations conducted by the Karnataka Examination Authority, and the State government is ready to conduct a high-level investigation if necessary, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Priyank Kharge has said. Addressing presspersons in Kalaburagi city on Wednesday, Mr. Kharge said though KEA had conducted the examination under tight security, handheld detectors and metal detectors were used in examination centres, some candidates entered the centre carrying Bluetooth devices. The police immediately arrested the candidates. Two accused are absconding. Replying to a question about the involvement of a senior official, Mr. Kharge said that the police will go to the bottom of this scam and whoever is found involved in this case will not be spared. Responding to a question about the BJP’s demand on handing over the case to CBI, Mr. Kharge reiterated that the police are conducting a comprehensive investigation into the case. Drought relief Recently a delegation from the State government had met Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and Union Agriculture Secretary and urged to release ₹17,000 crore as drought relief. Mr. Kharge said that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had written to Centre demanding to revise norms for assistance under NDRF rules to get adequate relief funds to the farmers who have suffered crop damages, the present NDRF rules will not benefit the farmers. However, the State government will release drought relief as per SDRF rules. The State government has also written to the Centre demanding the release of ₹700 crore of wages due to the State under MGNREGA scheme. We have also demanded the Centre to increase the working days from 100 to 150 days per year. Mr. Kharge also criticised the BJP-led government at the Centre for reducing the annual Budget allocation for MGNREGA from ₹89,400 crore in 2022-23 to ₹60,000 crore this year. The Minister said that the contract for the drinking water supply project in the city has been entrusted to the L&T Company, and also directed to use pipes approved by Central Institute of Plastics Engineering and Technology (CIPET), a third party inspection would be conducted, If the company was using sub-standard quality pipes, he added.","The Karnataka Police Department is conducting a thorough investigation into the KEA Bluetooth scam, where some candidates used Bluetooth devices to cheat in exams conducted by the Karnataka Examination Authority. Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Priyank Kharge stated that the government is prepared to conduct a high-level investigation if necessary. Despite tight security measures during the exams, some candidates managed to use Bluetooth devices, leading to their arrests. The police are determined to uncover any involvement of senior officials in the scam. The government has rejected the BJP's demand to hand over the case to the CBI, emphasizing the ongoing comprehensive police investigation.",Politics,2023-11-01 00:00:00
"In climate push, German chemical maker swaps oil for sugar","At one of Europe's largest chemical complexes, German group Covestro is trialling the manufacture of a key product using sugar as a base material instead of oil, as the industry seeks to reduce its carbon footprint. The pilot project involves producing ""aniline"", a chemical used in making foams — used widely in mattresses and armchairs, as well as building insulation. While large-scale, commercial production is probably years away, the experiment marks a small step in the chemical industry's battle to slash carbon emissions as Earth faces a dire climate emergency. Of the 100 million barrels of oil produced worldwide every day, ""a quarter goes directly into the chemical industry,"" said Walter Leitner, from Aachen University, which has been involved in the aniline project for a decade.","The transition from oil-based feedstock to sugar as a raw material by the German chemical maker represents a significant step towards sustainability and reducing carbon emissions in the manufacturing sector. Traditionally, many chemical processes rely on oil-derived feedstock, which not only contributes to carbon emissions but also perpetuates dependence on finite fossil fuel resources. By opting to use sugar as an alternative feedstock, the company is embracing a renewable and more environmentally friendly resource. Sugars, often derived from sources like sugarcane or sugar beets, are considered renewable because they can be sustainably grown and harvested without depleting finite resources or causing significant environmental harm. Furthermore, the use of sugar-based feedstock can help reduce the carbon footprint associated with the production process. Unlike oil-derived feedstock, which releases carbon dioxide when extracted and processed, sugars are derived from plants that absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. This means that the overall carbon emissions associated with the production process may be lower when using sugar-based feedstock compared to oil-based alternatives. Additionally, transitioning to sugar-based feedstock aligns with broader efforts to shift towards a more circular economy and reduce reliance on non-renewable resources. By utilizing agricultural by-products or waste streams as feedstock, companies can contribute to reducing waste and promoting a more sustainable approach to resource management. Overall, the decision to swap oil for sugar as a raw material reflects a commitment to sustainability, innovation, and environmental stewardship within the chemical manufacturing industry. It sets a positive example for other companies and industries seeking to reduce their environmental impact and transition towards more sustainable production practices.",Science and Technology,2024-03-11 00:00:00
Are slums a problem or solution? Slums represent a survival strategy in the face of insufficient &amp; affordable housing and lack of tenure security,"Tasleema, a widow, stays in a house constructed with cement sheets which are sometimes used as rooftops. She works in a tailoring unit near Yelahanka, Bangalore, and her shift timings are from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. As a single working mother, she leaves her two children, aged five and nine, at home, with no one to take care of them. The children are left to themselves to get ready to go to school. Manjunatha, a vegetable vendor, has to travel to the city market from his residence at Singapura. He leaves home at 5 a.m. on his two-wheeler and returns at 2 p.m. He spends approximately Rs.80 on travel daily, his daily income being Rs. 250. Their sagas give us a glimpse of the condition of the urban poor in Bangalore. The Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) conducted an urban poverty survey to understand the dynamics between livelihoods, mobility and shelter. This would provide insights into patterns that can help design sustainable and democratic policy alternatives and initiatives. CSTEP surveyed slums within and on the outskirts of the city, and compared the living conditions between them. The authors feel that slums do represent certain problems but provide solutions as well. Though a majority of the slums surveyed have pucca or semi-pucca houses, 90% of the households in the core slums have fewer than two rooms as opposed to 65% houses in the peripheral areas. There is a pattern where people are willing to give up better living conditions (more space and toilets on premises) for better opportunities in the core areas. Some of them do not move to the new/relocated areas as their livelihood is deeply rooted in these slums (core) and the new areas have poor accessibility and livelihood options are limited. Intrinsic skills like zari making are related to specific markets. Relocation renders these skills redundant. The credit ecosystem that existed based on trust, social relationship and nurtured for generations is also lost. Unemployment and credit opportunities have a cyclical impact on each other. Credit makes it easy for people to start small businesses and skill-based work such as carpentry, driving autorickshaws and taxis, and employment makes it easy for people to get and pay back credit on time. It is, thus, crucial to understand the link between shelter and livelihood options. This is the reason for the failure of most of the slum relocation schemes — these disconnect the urban functions. It is imperative that thoughtful planning be done to rehabilitate the economic opportunities for these people. Accessibility to basic facilities like water and sanitation is inferior in the peripheral areas (Table 1). Waste flows into pits (not septic tanks), which are dug in every house, due to a lack of sewage connections. Water quality and its impact on health are also areas of concern. Slums in the core areas have better access to education, especially higher education, also. Lack of accessibility to medical centres is acuter in peripheral slums. There is a dichotomy in the mobility needs of the city (Table 2). This is not reflected in transport plans and budgets. Core slums are sometimes inaccessible by buses, and people have to either take an autorickshaw to reach the nearest bus stop (around two km) or walk the distance. Peripheral slums, due to the remoteness with limited mobility options, incur high transport costs. The analysis shows that there is lack of affordable transport, which coupled with lack of reasonably priced housing near employment centres/dense residential areas, restricts the access to basic facilities and opportunities for better living conditions. Mobility forms the crucial link between shelter and livelihood. Our case studies also demonstrate active cooperation from the slum dwellers with government agencies when they are convinced that they will not be evicted. This is crucial in both rebuilding, redeveloping and maintaining less serviced urban areas. Broadly speaking, slums are perceived as a hindrance if a city is dreaming of a world-class image and the Slum Clearance Board often takes initiatives to clear them. Alternatively, slums can be viewed as partial solutions to a bigger problem. They represent a survival strategy in the face of insufficient affordable housing and lack of tenure security, often blending production and distribution spaces along with living quarters. They demonstrate innovative shelters and efficient livelihood strategies, which form an important part of the urban ecosystem. A major chunk of informal employment is from the slums. The prominent professions among the urban poor are that of housemaids, sweepers, rag-pickers, autorickshaw drivers, vegetable vendors and watchmen, to name a few. Their lives are non-descript and invisible but each of them helps in the functioning of a city or a family. Slums represent certain problems and yet provide solutions and they are here to stay. The study concludes that: *The success of slum development and rehabilitation schemes/other schemes lies in focussing not only on building houses but also promoting livelihood options and affordable social infrastructure and mobility options to livelihoods — the urban ecosystem as a whole. *The services and lives of the slum people need to be acknowledged and included in designing solutions, through participatory negotiations and institutions. This will make them more responsible towards cities and their infrastructure. A recognised urban habitation system is required to make the poor eligible for basic amenities. This will also help in facilitating access to government schemes and services. ( Sujaya Rathi, Principal Research Scientist; Mohammed Syed Faisal, Research Analyst; and Debapriya Das, Research Economist, Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, Bangalore )","The urban poverty survey conducted by CSTEP in Bangalore sheds light on the challenges faced by the urban poor, focusing on livelihoods, mobility, and shelter. It reveals that slums, while presenting problems, also offer solutions and innovative livelihood strategies. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the link between shelter and livelihood options, advocating for thoughtful planning to rehabilitate economic opportunities and provide access to basic facilities. It calls for inclusive solutions that acknowledge the contributions of slum dwellers and promote their participation in urban development initiatives.",Opinion and Editorial,2013-07-13 00:00:00

No record of Netaji's stay in Russia: Declassified files,"New Delhi: There was no record of stay of Subhash Chandra Bose in Soviet Union in 1945 and thereafter, according to a new set of 25 declassified files on Netaji released in New Delhi on Friday. This revelation challenges a belief that Bose had fled to Russia and was not killed in an air carsh in 1945 in Taipei. In a letter, dated January 8, 1992, to Indian Embassy in Moscow, the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Russian Federation has said, ""...according to the data in the Central and Republican archives, no information whatsoever is available on the stay of the former President of Indian National Congress Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose in the Soviet Union in 1945 and thereafter."" The disappearance of Netaji 70 years ago remains a mystery with two Commissions of Inquiry concluding that Netaji had died in a plane crash in Taipei on August 18, 1945 while a third probe panel, headed by Justice M K Mukherjee, had contested it and suggested that Bose was alive. Culture Secretary N K Sinha released online the sixth batch of 25 declassified files related to Netaji. The present batch of 25 files pertains to Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) during 1952-2014. The first lot of 100 files relating to Netaji were put in public domain by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 23 on the occasion of the 119th birth anniversary of Netaji. The second lot of 50 files was released in March and 25 files each were put in public domain in the subsequent months.","A newly released set of 25 declassified files has revealed that there is no record of Subhash Chandra Bose staying in the Soviet Union in 1945 or afterwards, challenging the belief that he fled to Russia instead of dying in a 1945 plane crash in Taipei.

Heathrow gets a taste of 'dharna',"The dharna down at Heathrow, which fancies itself as ""hub of the world"", is instructive at this point of time in Britain's maudlin preoccupation with multiculturalism. The strike started after a dharna. There is no other word for it and never mind that it is manifestly foreign to British working practices. Even though the dharna, may not, at last count, have entered numerous English language portals, such as the OED, it is an Indian import into the British capital. It underlines the complex multi-layering of 21st-century Britain's identity as a ""salad bowl"" of immigrants and white host community. The dharna was started and pursued by women in saris, most of them from Punjab, who have been residents of Britain for 20, 30, even 40 years. These women, who worked at an airline catering firm, Gate Gourmet, felt aggrieved about their treatment at the hands of their company. They claim they're paid less than starvation wages (for an expensive city like London) of just �� 12,000 a year. That works out to approximately �� 6.20 an hour. It is, they claim, ludicrously low to live decently. Even then, they claimed, they were willing to soldier on. But Gate Gourmet, they say, summarily sacked them ��� by megaphone or mail. They felt victims of an infringement of their rights as workers, indeed, as fully paid-up British workers within the human rights-sensitive European Union. So the Sabajit Sidhus and Tara Shahs, dressed in their salwar-kameezes and saris, sat down, struck work and engineered a wildcat strike that brought British Airways to its knees","The recent dharna at Heathrow Airport symbolizes Britain's multiculturalism challenges. Originating from Indian culture, it reflects the country's diverse identity. Led by long-time British residents, predominantly Punjabi women, working at Gate Gourmet, the strike protested unjust treatment and low wages. Despite their dedication, the company's abrupt dismissals sparked outrage. This led to a wildcat strike, crippling British Airways operations. The event highlights the clash between immigrant workers' rights and corporate policies, showcasing the complexities of 21st-century Britain's identity as a melting pot of cultures and socioeconomic challenges.",Religion and Spirituality,2005-08-14 00:00:00
Arvind Kejriwal fires back at PM Modis Sheesh Mahal jibe with 10 lakh suit slam he abuses me because,"Delhi Election 2025: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for abusing the people of Delhi and the majority government elected by them. The former chief minister claimed that PM Modi would not need to abuse himif his government had performed well in the ten years of power at the Centre since 2014. PM Modi gave a speech of 43 minutes today. For about 39 minutes, he abused the people of Delhi and the elected government. Had Modi government performed in ten years, he would not have needed to abuse the people of Delhi, Kejriwal said at a press conference on Friday, hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi sounded the poll bugle for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of next month's Delhi Assembly Election 2025. In his first public rally in poll-bound Delhi, Modi launched a scathing attack on the AAP and its national convenor, Kejriwal. Without naming anyone, Modi accused the AAP government of pushing the national capital into an AAPda or disaster in the last 10 years of its rule. Someone who has made a house worth 2,700 crore for himself, someone who flies in 8,400 crore plane and someone who wears a suit worth 10 lakh talks about Sheesh Mahal doesn't sound good. I do not want to indulge in personal attacks. I do not do politics of abuse. I have worked enough in the last ten years. I believe in politics of development, Kejriwal said, Kejriwal referred to the custom-made Narendra Damodardas Modi pinstriped suit that reports suggested was worth 10 lakh. The suit entered the Guinness Book of world records when a man from Surat bought the suit at an auction for 4.3 crore in February 2016. Modi's Sheesh Mahal Jibe at KejriwalModi accused the AAP government of blocking the Union government's benefits for the people of the national capital and took an indirect swipe at Arvind Kejriwal for building a Sheesh Mahal for himself while he was the chief minister of Delhi. In the last 10 years, Delhi has been surrounded by an AAPda (disaster). By keeping Anna Hazare at the front, a few dishonest people have pushed Delhi towards a disaster. People of Delhi have pledged that they will no more tolerate this AAPda ..., the prime minister said using an AAP world play while addressing a public meeting at Ashok Vihar's Ramlila Ground in the national capital. Modi's address is being seen as the launch of BJP campaign for Delhi Assembly Election 2025. The elections to the 70-member Delhi assembly are expected to be held in February. The Election Commission of India has not announced the dates yet. The term of the current assembly in Delhi expires on February 23, 2025. Kejriwal also hit out at the BJP for not having a CM face and fighting elections without an agenda. There are over 4 lakh jhuggis in Delhi, 15 lakh people need houses, and today BJP is trying to pat their backs for constructing 1700 homes that too in 5 years, Kejriwal said, recalling Modi's promise of constructing houses for everyone in Delhi by 2022. It seems to me that BJPs Sankalp Patra is not something they want to do in 5 years but perhaps 200 years. With the speed at which they are working, the next set of houses will be ready only by 2030. But even that wont happen given the way BJP is demolishing Jhuggis, Kejriwal said. Earlier in the day, Modi inaugurated a slew of developmental projects in the national capital, ahead of assembly polls. He inaugurated 1,675 newly constructed flats for the dwellers of JJ clusters and also handed over keys to beneficiaries at Swabhiman Apartments in Ashok Vihar, Delhi.",Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for abusing the people of Delhi and the majority government elected by them.

"After rough ride in 2024, Indian startups look for a promising new year","The Indian startup ecosystem experienced a rollercoaster ride in 2024, characterised by a slight-yet-concerning decline in funding activity and a shift in investor sentiment, alongside a silver lining with several startups achieving unicorn status. Despite facing global economic challenges, India's startups showcased remarkable resilience, adeptly navigating changing market conditions, while continuing to attract investments. According to data from Tracxn, Indian startups raised a total of USD 30.4 billion in funding throughout 2024, a 6.5 per cent decline from the USD 32.5 billion secured in 2023. Despite this dip, the Indian startup ecosystem demonstrated resilience, with several companies achieving unicorn status this year. Noteworthy entrants to the unicorn club include Rapido, Ather, Perfios, Porter, and Money View, highlighting ongoing innovation and investment interest in the sector. The overall funding trend reflects a cautious-yet-optimistic approach from investors, as they navigate a more selective funding environment, while still recognising the potential of high-growth startups in India. A slight shift towards early-stage investments was evident during the year, with seed and Series A rounds gaining traction, as investors sought to back innovative ideas with long-term potential. Businesses that could demonstrate robust underlying unit economics found greater favour this year, Dushyant Singh, Managing Partner at Playbook Partners, noted. Gig economy, retail, and enterprise applications stood out as top-performing sectors, according to Traxcn. Quick commerce emerged as a high-growth sector, with 40 active companies, including unicorns Zepto, Blinkit, and Swiggy Instamart, and promising newcomers Dunzo, Swish, and Farmako. In July, the government announced the abolishment of the angel tax on investments in startups to provide a more conducive environment for growth. ""By eliminating this tax, the government has provided a much-needed boost to investors and entrepreneurs, enabling greater liquidity and more flexible funding options for startups. However, fewer funding rounds, high operational costs, and infrastructure challenges remain ongoing factors that need attention,"" said Jeenendra Bhandari, Chairman, JITO Incubation and Innovation Foundation (JIIF). There was an encouraging rise in women entrepreneurs and founders from Tier 2 and 3 towns. Ninad Karpe from 100X.VC said the entrepreneurial culture has transcended its traditional boundaries. ""The entrepreneurial culture has transcended its traditional boundaries, seeping into colleges, schools, and even Tier 2 and 3 towns. Founders from these regions are bringing fresh perspectives, solving hyperlocal problems, and creating opportunities that were previously untapped. ""There's a noticeable rise in women entrepreneurs, signalling a positive shift in inclusivity and diversity within the startup ecosystem,"" he said. According to official data, India has more than 73,000 startups with at least one woman director that have been recognised under the Startup India Initiative. Despite the positive trends, challenges persist. Global economic uncertainties have a direct impact on investor sentiment and funding availability. ""While the number of deals has seen a quarterly increase of 10-20 per cent... Deal values have declined significantly. This reflects a cautious investment climate, with most funding rounds being either follow-ons by existing investors or bridge rounds aimed at extending the runway rather than driving growth. The focus has shifted from valuation-driven funding to sustainability and profitability,"" FAAD Capital CEO Aditya Arora said. The growth in venture capital this year was mainly driven by increase in mid and late-stage investment, Singh seconded. Startups continue to grapple with rising operational costs, which can strain their financial sustainability. Several Indian startups have gained fame and achieved unicorn status despite not being profitable. Many startups still face challenges related to inadequate physical infrastructure, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. This can hugely affect logistics, supply chain management, and overall operational efficiency. Moreover, navigating compliance requirements can be cumbersome for new businesses, diverting resources away from innovation and growth. A fitting saying for the current situation of the Indian startup ecosystem could be: ""In the midst of adversity, hope is the seed from which resilience grows."" Despite a rough patch in recent years, the Indian startup landscape has shown remarkable buoyancy. The increasing trend of Indians returning from abroad to establish businesses is also expected to invigorate the ecosystem with global expertise, Bhandari believes. Cautious optimism in 2024 is expected to continue into 2025, broader market recovery may still be two years away, with significant improvements anticipated by 2026, Arora said. ""In the interim, the ecosystem is expected to witness an increase in SME IPOs, unlocking real value for investors and startups alike,"" he said. The rise of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain technologies is expected to attract significant investment. Startups leveraging these technologies will likely be at the forefront of funding conversations. Deloitte's Chirag Agrawal said AI is enabling efficient operations and supporting data-driven decision-making. AI-focused startups are attracting significant investments, particularly in high-impact areas such as healthcare, finance, and sustainability, he said. ""For 2025, India's entrepreneurial ecosystem is poised for continued growth, driven by technological advancements, government reforms, and a favourable macroeconomic environment. ""Emerging trends include significant investments in Deep Tech, Electric Vehicles, Clean Tech, Defence Tech, and Space Tech. These sectors are expected to attract substantial funding, particularly in AI, sustainable technologies, and space commercialization, positioning India as a global leader in these high-potential areas,"" he said.","In 2024, India’s startup ecosystem navigated a year of cautious optimism, marked by a 6.5% dip in funding to $30.4 billion but also a show of resilience and innovation. Despite global headwinds and tighter investor scrutiny, startups like Rapido, Ather, Porter, and Money View joined the unicorn club, reflecting sustained interest in high-growth ventures. A growing focus on early-stage funding and startups with strong unit economics showed a shift toward sustainability over hyper-growth. Key sectors such as gig economy, retail, enterprise tech, and quick commerce saw strong momentum. Government reforms like the abolition of angel tax gave the ecosystem a boost, as did rising entrepreneurship from women and Tier 2/3 cities. However, challenges such as high operational costs, infrastructure gaps, and complex compliance norms persist. Looking ahead, AI, clean tech, defence, and space are poised to drive the next wave of growth. While full recovery may take until 2026, experts anticipate a rise in SME IPOs and deeper investments in deep tech and sustainability, keeping India’s startup story vibrant and evolving.",Business and Finance,2025-01-01 00:00:00

Maharashtra Budget: Can Ajit Pawar’s fiscal plan control rising deficits and balance public needs?,"In the first three days of March, Maharashtra’s financial situation was revealed: It tops the chart in the country’s State numbers for GST collection for February 2025, with Rs.30,637 crore; the State finance minister, Ajit Pawar, sought a supplementary Rs.6,486 crore on March 3. This demand was raised days before the presentation of the State budget on March 10. Although the State is doing well compared to others, bringing in financial discipline appears to be the biggest challenge before Pawar. The Mahayuti alliance—constituted by the BJP, Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party—won back the State in the 2024 Assembly elections. But Mahayuti leaders ignored the financial situation. They spent big money: The Ladki Bahin scheme cost Rs.46,000 core (almost 10 per cent of the State’s revenue); the Tirth Darshan scheme; the Anandacha Shidha scheme (where ration was given free on special occasions); the Chief Minister Internship scheme (where 10,000 graduates were supposed to be awarded Rs.10,000 per month as apprenticeship.) Together, these schemes cost over Rs.1 lakh crore, a jump from the Rs.85,000 crore deficit in 2022-2024, when the government cleared many infrastructure proposals in the areas of health, public work, medical education and rural development. Pawar, therefore, while presenting the budget for 2025-26, will have to demonstrate how he will bring down the deficit.","Maharashtra led February 2025 GST collections with ₹30,637 crore, yet Finance Minister Ajit Pawar sought a supplementary ₹6,486 crore before the March 10 State budget.

Scheduled Tribe panel objects to merger of schemes under New Social Mission,"The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) has objected to the contours of the newly conceived flagship mission - PM Social Inclusion Mission for Welfare of SCs and STs (PMSIM) - which will implement targeted schemes for the socially and economically backward Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The NCST has objected to the clubbing of two major programmes - Development Action Plan for Scheduled Castes (DAPSC) and Scheduled Tribe Component (STC) - of the Centre under the new mission. So far, the two programmes were separate and required 41 Central ministries and departments to allocate at least population proportion of Budget outlay - which is 16.6% for Scheduled Castes and 8.6% for Scheduled Tribes - for targeted schemes. The new mission has put the two initiatives under one umbrella. According to sources, the NCST has conveyed to the government that the problems of SCs and STs are ""distinctly different in nature and require separate strategies for identification of gaps and prevailing disparities as well as providing administrative arrangements and solutions thereof are also likely to be different for both categories"". It recommended that separate guidelines and strategies be adopted for STs.

He then increased his speed to 325 beats per minute. “This is genuinely one of the best things I’ve ever seen live,” tweeted James Corden, host of the show. Lydian also featured on the Ellen DeGeneres show last week after his appearance on the ‘The World’s Best’ contest. The teenager, who is home schooled, told The Hindu that he spends on an average of six hours a day practising music under the guidance of his father Varshan Satish, a music director. “I listen to music on YouTube and spend time going through music software. Along with my sister, I experiment a lot and we compose our own music,” said Lydian. The prodigy can play blindfolded, handle two pianos simultaneously, apart from being adept at playing the guitar and mridangam, his mother Jhansi said with legitimate pride. Currently, he is investing time on the technical side learning skills such as mixing, sound systems. The lad does not watch much television, but he is a regular on YouTube. “I recently picked up a movie from YouTube, then muted the sound and created my own audio. It was fun,” he said. Citing an example, he said he had tried this experiment with the animation Storks. His performance has earned him an invite to the Jazz Foundation of America’s annual gala “A Great Night in Harlem” at the Apollo Theatre in New York on April 4. Lydian says he wants to compose music for Hollywood. “I want to work for an animation film,” he said, adding that he also wants to play the piano on the moon at some point. Lydian’s father, Varshan, said: “Last year, Micheal Novogratz sent Lydian a Steinway grand piano. Now he has invited him to perform at the concert with some musicians.” His mother Jhansi proudly said that he also plays the guitar, mridangam among other instruments. On Thursday afternoon, Oscar winner A R Rahman went to Lydian’s house in Saligramam (Chennai) and appreciated him. Lydian has spent four-years training on a full-scholarship at AR Rahman’s KM Music Conservatory under Surojeet Chatterji in the Russian Piano School.","Lydian Nadhaswaram, the 13-year-old pianist from Chennai, was crowned winner of 'The World's Best' global talent contest, securing $1 million.

Demonetisation problems will end in 10-15 days: Centre to SC,"In a hearing on its decision to impose demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes, the government today told the Supreme Court that the problems being faced by people will be over in ""10-15 days"".Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, representing the government, said it is ""not sitting around doing nothing"" and claimed no violence or unrest has been reported in the last month.""The government is not sitting around doing nothing. In 10-15 days, it will all be over,"" Rohatgi told a three-judge Supreme Court bench, which is hearing a number of petitions challenging the note ban.The Supreme Court asked the Centre whether its demonetisation decision was taken in absolute secrecy.

Ease these growing pains,"The agro-chemical industry is struggling with poor awareness among farmers, lack of innovation and low investment in R&D Every business has its challenges and the agro-chemical industry is no exception to this rule. On the face of it, the industry is plagued by poor uptake of farm input materials, lack of awareness and knowledge among farmers, zero innovation and scanty investment in Research and Development (R&D). Apart from this, it is also grappling with some serious issues like the markets being flooded with spurious and low quality materials. Some may also count the advent of genetically-modified (GM) products and meeting strict regulatory needs as the other sore points. As we enter a new era of governance and welcome a new Government, it is necessary to draw the attention of the nation’s policy-makers to the issues that are bogging us down and impeding our momentum. Farmers resist change: As a professional who works with people at the grassroots, I see a problem at a deeper level — the reluctance of farmers to adopt anything that counters their traditional understanding of farming. They are resistant to anything that they think could damage their crops, even if it means that they get lower price for their yield when not using agro-chemicals. They are not aware of the right agro-chemicals, nor do they know the right time and amount to use for the type of crop they are growing. I can understand their concern over crop volumes as they struggle against volatile market prices but their lack of awareness and understanding is harming their prospects more than the prices. Hence, many companies have initiated training of farmers along with the Government but there’s a long way to go. Overdependence on generic agro-chemicals: Insecticides dominate the crop protection industry in India and have a 50 per cent market share, with herbicides, fungicides, micronutrients, plant growth regulators and bio-stimulants capturing the other half of the market. A bulk of domestic consumption of insecticides and herbicides is generic in nature and this demand is likely to grow in future, mainly due to the price difference with branded ones. The fact remains that generic agro-chemicals are popular among farmers. In the absence of new, patented products in the market, they grow dependent on available varieties. Industry majors continuously try to reverse this trend by bringing in products from other countries to provide variety to farmers and introduce better products in the market. They also enter into partnerships and tie-ups with multinational corporations abroad to hasten the process. Poor supply chain management and counterfeit products: India needs efficient distribution systems to let more farmers access these products. Problems of supply chain inefficiencies and inadequate infrastructure have plagued the agro-chemical industry, which result in post-harvest losses estimated at Rs 45,000 crore every year, says a FICCI report. The lack of an efficient distribution system also makes it difficult for agro-chemical companies to reach out to farmers to promote their products and educate them about their usage and benefits. Besides, generic products are prone to counterfeiting. These sub-standard products not only prove to be ineffective but also harm crops many times. They hurt the laboriously-built reputation of agro-chemical companies. A poor supply chain and the ignorance of farmers facilitate the entry of counterfeit products, especially in remote areas. R&D investment is a sticking point: R&D is crucial for developing new molecules and improving existing products. But the cost is high. Apart from the cost of setting up a research facility, tracking the right resources and running it call for sustained investment while the return is slow. That prevents firms from investing in R&D as well as any other similar project. What they do not realise is that in order to improve the products and to reduce their prices, R&D is needed. While research on GM crops is being extended to almost everything that can be cultivated, not much is being done by way of research in the agro-chemical industry. Had this sector been given that amount of attention, especially in tropical countries where crops are more vulnerable than temperate climates, we may not have been struggling on issues like farmers’ income and food security.","The agro-chemical industry in India faces several challenges that hinder its growth and efficiency. These include poor awareness among farmers regarding agro-chemical usage, lack of innovation and investment in Research and Development (R&D), overdependence on generic products, and issues with supply chain management such as counterfeit products. Farmers' resistance to adopting new methods and the dominance of generic agro-chemicals in the market further exacerbate these challenges. The industry struggles with high costs associated with R&D, which limits its ability to develop new, effective products tailored to the needs of Indian agriculture. Addressing these issues requires improved farmer education, enhanced distribution systems, and increased R&D investment to drive innovation and sustainability in the sector.",Agriculture,2019-08-31 00:00:00

"Learner’s Park; A fulfilling career often sprouts from genuine enthusiasm, says Dhruv Galgotia of Galgotias University","Dhruv Galgotia, CEO of Galgotias University shares his views on opportunities and challenges of the education system in India with FE Education Online What is the best thing about today’s education system? Today’s education system excels due to its dynamic and adaptive nature, diverging from the traditional confines of classrooms. It actively promotes interactive and collaborative learning through project-based methodologies, inviting students to immerse themselves in their educational journey. These approaches, enriched by collaborative projects emphasizing teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity, create a dynamic environment fostering hands-on experiences and peer interaction. This evolution enhances engagement and cultivates crucial skills like critical thinking and adaptability, crucial for navigating a swiftly evolving world. Moreover, the contemporary education landscape champions innovation, granting students the freedom to explore diverse fields, engage in global collaboration, and access a wealth of knowledge instantly. This adaptability not only fuels creativity but also hones problem-solving abilities, ensuring students are well-prepared to confront the challenges presented by our rapidly changing world. What is the one thing you would like to change in the system? The one thing I would like to change in the system is the focus on rote learning. Rote learning encourages students to memorize information without truly understanding the underlying concepts. I believe it’s crucial to shift the emphasis towards a more holistic and experiential learning approach. This means encouraging interactive learning, critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity in classrooms. By promoting a deeper understanding of subjects and nurturing practical skills, we can better prepare students for the complexities of the modern world. This change would not only enhance the quality of education but also empower students to apply their knowledge meaningfully in various real-life situations, fostering a more innovative and adaptable workforce for the future. What is the role digital has played in the evolution of the education system? Digital technology has profoundly transformed education, serving as a democratizing force that brings knowledge within reach of millions worldwide. It transcends geographical limitations, enabling students to access expertise from across the globe. Additionally, digital tools have revolutionized personalized learning, catering to diverse learning styles and offering real-time feedback for continuous enhancement. Alongside this digital evolution, the advent of AI, exemplified by ChatGPT and other AI technologies, has brought both merits to the education landscape. AI, like ChatGPT, offers unparalleled access to information, aids in personalized learning experiences, and facilitates instant assistance. What has been the disadvantage of digital in education? While digital technology has revolutionized education, it has also brought challenges. One significant disadvantage is the digital divide. Not all students have equal access to computers and the internet, creating disparities in learning opportunities. Moreover, there are concerns about online distractions and the need for digital literacy to discern credible information from misinformation. Balancing the benefits of technology with addressing these challenges is crucial for a holistic and inclusive education system. What is the career advice you would like to give to students? My advice to students is multifaceted. Firstly, embrace the ethos of lifelong learning. Cultivate curiosity, stay abreast of industry trends, and commit to continuous skill development, ensuring adaptability in the future job market. Secondly, prioritise the refinement of soft skills like communication, teamwork, and leadership, recognizing their universal importance across professions. Thirdly, consider the paradigm of becoming job creators rather than solely job seekers. Entrepreneurship and innovation offer avenues to shape industries and create opportunities. Lastly, follow your passions ardently. A fulfilling career often sprouts from genuine enthusiasm. Believe in your capabilities, set audacious goals, and let perseverance and diligence pave your unique path to success. Remember, education forms the base, but your choices and endeavors define your journey to triumph.","Dhruv Galgotia, CEO of Galgotias University, highlights the strengths and challenges of India's education system. He praises its dynamic and interactive nature, promoting collaborative learning and critical thinking. However, he emphasizes the need to move away from rote learning towards holistic, experiential learning. Digital technology has played a transformative role, democratizing education and enabling personalized learning. Despite its benefits, the digital divide and concerns about online distractions remain challenges. Galgotia advises students to prioritize lifelong learning, develop soft skills, consider entrepreneurship, and pursue their passions. He believes in the transformative power of education and encourages students to be proactive in shaping their future.",Education,2023-12-24 00:00:00

FE Editorial : A super regulator?,"This is open season on regulatory reform. Not just in the West, where the first Lehman anniversary has sharpened debates, but also in India, where many are re-congratulating themselves on possessing the regulatory wisdom that prevented Lehmans happening here. The India story is a little more complicated than that. But let?s note, first, that the Indian government has entered the debate with a proposal, as reported in The Indian Express, that apparently has political traction and political authority at the heart of it: the finance minister heads a super regulator?a regulator of all financial regulators that will be called Financial Services & Development Authority (FSDA) and will replace the loose arrangement called the high-level coordination committee that exists now. Is this a good idea? The way to answer this question is not to immediately get into academic arcana on regulatory models. Both the American and British models were exposed as effectively not having a clue to the crisis. And while India didn?t have a crisis, it has a slow, small, inefficient banking system that can?t prune lending costs and fails to effectively serve a trillion-dollar economy hosting a billion people. Regulatory failure can be terribly model-invariant. So, let?s ask the following simple questions. First, will FSDA be able to make regulators under it change their ways, drop their resistance, if change reduces a particular regulator?s remit, but increases regulatory effectiveness? An excellent example is the Debt Management Office (DMO). The DMO is a done deal in terms of preparatory work. RBI says this is not the right time. And everyone in the system seems to accept this. Will FSDA be the kind of body that will push through a DMO? On paper, it should be able to. But governance is about the difference between what?s on paper and what gets done. Second, will FSDA be the kind of body that sees financial regulation for what it is?basically, a system that tries to promote returns over the long term with as little friction as possible? This would mean, for example, asking questions like, how deep and liquid should the debt market be and should there be a different commodities market regulator? These and other questions will involve both theory and turf, and FSDA must be a body that has sufficient intellectual and political heft to sort them out. Third, accepting the argument that if and when financial firms need a bailout, a political figure like the FM should be formally making the last call, the question persists whether politics of the dodgier kind will be kept out of FSDA?s deliberations. Bailouts are high-stakes games?who to save, who not to, how much money to commit, who should lose his shirt and who gets to keep it, all of which are complicated by the large public sector presence in Indian finance. Let?s have some answers to these questions.","The Indian government is considering a regulatory reform proposal involving the creation of the Financial Services & Development Authority (FSDA) to oversee all financial regulators. The move aims to enhance regulatory coordination and effectiveness in the financial sector. The article questions whether FSDA can bring about necessary changes, particularly in areas like introducing a Debt Management Office (DMO), addressing theoretical and practical aspects of financial regulation, and ensuring politics does not compromise decision-making on bailouts.",Business and Finance,2009-12-09 00:00:00
Cong likely to start talks on seat sharing from Jan 1st week,"The Congress is likely to begin talks with the parties from the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) on seat sharing for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from the first week of January, party sources said on Friday.

The INDIA is an umbrella group of the Opposition parties formed in July this year to take on the ruling BJP in the general elections.

Helpline for MPs gets eclectic calls from public,"New Delhi : It was meant to be an exclusive, 24/7 helpline for members of the Lok Sabha to access reference notes and background material for taking part in debates. But from the start, people who staff the helpline have been kept busy fending off queries from citizens on issues that have nothing to do with Parliament. Some people have dialled the helpline to ask for PM Narendra Modi’s phone number. One person called up the staff to seek an appointment with the PM as he “needs to give the PM some advice on the farmers’ protests”, officials involved in the project said on condition of anonymity. Planned by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, the helpline became operational on the eve of the budget session that began on Friday to help MPs quickly access reference notes and background material for debates. The round-the-clock service can be availed from anywhere in the country and abroad. But the helpline started buzzing with calls after the contact numbers were frequently flashed on the Lok Sabha TV channel that is very popular in rural belts and smaller towns. “We got many enquiries with curious people asking ‘when are we getting the Covid-19 vaccines.’ While these calls reflect genuine concerns of people, unfortunately the helpline can’t solve their issues,” said one of the officials cited above.","The 24/7 helpline established for Lok Sabha members to access reference notes and background material for debates is inundated with queries unrelated to Parliament.

Hyderabad survived ‘emergency’ 27 years before rest of India,"Did you know that Hyderabad state had experienced a sort of emergency in 1948, almost 27 years before the rest of India in 1975? Though the reasons behind the declaration of a state of emergency in 1948 and 1975 were different and a parallel cannot be drawn between them, on both occasions thousands of people were put behind the bars without trial for several months, according to archival records and researchers. In 1948, special courts or tribunals were set up in Hyderabad state to deal with people arrested on different charges and finally thousands were released without trial. Initially, there was no right to appeal for the convicts. Documents available at the National Archives of India (NAI) reveal the princely state was put under a state of emergency soon after the Operation Polo, popularly known as Police Action, on September 17, 1948. Ministry The Central government then came out with what was called the special courts order. Though the idea behind the special courts was delivery of speedy justice, many of those arrested were not put on trial. As the pressure from international human rights bodies mounted on the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru government, many were released without trial. In the case of remaining prisoners, trial was speeded up to release them, archival re cords show. Interestingly, a study of NAI documents and the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in Janardhan Reddy and others vs the State (1951 AIR 124, 1950 SCR 940) delivered on December 14, 1950, reveals Hyderabad had actually joined the Indian Union on January 26, 1950, the day India became a Republic. The SC judgment pertained to an appeal filed by 12 prisoners, who were convicted and sentenced to death by a special tribunal (court) in Hyderabad. They were all held after the Police Action. The prisoners first appealed to the high court of Hyderabad against their conviction and sentence. The high court, however, dismissed their plea and upheld the conviction. On January 21, 1950, the convicts appealed to the high court seeking permission to challenge its order before the judicial committee of Hyderabad. The judicial committee was the highest appellate body in Hyderabad state before it was wound up on January 26, 1950. According to the headnote of the SC judgment, “on January 26, 1950, the Constitution of India came into force and under the Constitution, Hyderabad became a part of India. The judicial committee of Hyderabad ceased to exist, and all appeals and other proceedings pending before that committee were transferred to the Supreme Court of India.” According to researchers, September 17, 1948, was the day the Indian Army entered the city and the actual merger took place many months later. Even the outcome of the order on the special leave appeal was quite interesting. “Inasmuch as Article 136 confers power on the Supreme Court to grant special leave to appeal only from any judgment, decree, sentence, or order passed or made by “any court or tribunal in the territory of India,” and the Hyderabad high court was not a court in the territory of India when the judgments in question were pronounced, the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to grant special leave,” the headnote to the judgement read. Taylor C Sherman, professor of South Asian History at the London School of Economics & Political Science, in her research paper, “The integration of the princely state of Hyderabad and the making of the postcolonial state in India, 1948-56”, published by LSE Research Online, referred to the declaration of a state of emergency in Hyderabad. “Shortly after the proclamation of the state of emer gency, the Government of India propounded a special courts order to dispense with the large numbers of persons in jail… at first, it provided for no right to appeal to higher courts. This latter provision was amended in October 1949, to allow appeals to the high court for major offences,” Sherman wrote quoting NAI","In 1948, Hyderabad state experienced a state of emergency, 27 years before the rest of India declared one in 1975. Following Operation Polo (Police Action) on September 17, 1948, which saw the Indian Army enter Hyderabad, a state of emergency was declared, and special courts were set up to handle arrests. Thousands were detained without trial, and international pressure led to the release of many without trial. Hyderabad officially joined the Indian Union on January 26, 1950, the day India became a Republic. The Supreme Court of India, in a 1951 judgment, noted that Hyderabad had become part of India under the new constitution.",Business and Finance,2023-09-27 00:00:00
"BJP will close Tasmac outlets in T.N. in three years if voted to power, says K. Annamalai","Bharatiya Janata Party State president K. Annamalai on Friday said that if the BJP is voted to power in the State, Tasmac outlets would be closed in three years. Mr. Annamalai led the En Mann En Makkal yatra covering Salem South, Salem North, and Salem West Assembly constituencies. Earlier speaking to reporters, Mr. Annamalai said that the DMK government borrowed ₹2.69 lakh crore in 31 months, and if the present situation continues, the total debt of Tamil Nadu will reach ₹10 lakh crore. From day one, DMK says the financial position is not good and is continuing the same after 31 months. The DMK government does not have the ability to improve financial position. “As I said earlier, after the drama, now the DMK government has announced ₹1,000 along with Pongal gift hamper. When the DMK was in the opposition, they urged to give ₹5,000 for the Pongal festival, but now, pointing out financial position, they are giving ₹1,000,” he said.","Bharatiya Janata Party State president K.

Man held for sexually assaulting minor,"CHENNAI: Police on Saturday arrested a 41-year-old man for sexually assaulting a seven-year-old girl who lives with her family in a rented house in New Washermanpet. The girl, a native of Bihar, resides with her family on the first floor of a two-storeyed building in New Washermanpet, with the house owner Kutti Vel on the ground floor. When neighbours heard the girl screaming from her residence on Saturday, they rushed in only to see Vel sexually assaulting her. He was under the influence of alcohol and half-naked. The neighbours thrashed Vel before taking him to the local police station. Vel reportedly was living alone. His wife had left him with their two children for her parents' home after a family dispute. Vel, a daily labourer in a private company, had rented out the first floor of his house to the family from Bihar. The girl's father, Surendar Sharma, is an employee in a shutter manufacturing company in the city. On Saturday, Sharma's wife had gone out, leaving her daughter alone at home. The girl, a Class I student in a private school, was playing at home as it was a holiday for her. Vel sneaked into the house pretending to ask for something. Noticing her alone, he took undue advantage. Based on Sharma's complaint, New Washermanpet police have registered a case and booked Vel under Section 377 (unnatural sex) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Police arrested him and remanded him in prison after producing him before a magistrate on Sunday.","A 41-year-old man, Kutti Vel, was arrested in Chennai for sexually assaulting a seven-year-old girl from Bihar who lived in a rented house in New Washermanpet.

Syria peace efforts must continue despite ties break with Russia: John Kerry,"US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday efforts to end Syria’s war must continue despite Washington’s decision to break off talks with Moscow over what he called its “irresponsible” support for President Bashar al-Assad. The United States on Monday suspended talks with Russia on implementing a ceasefire deal in Syria, accusing Moscow of not living up to its commitments to halt fighting and ensure aid reached besieged communities. “We are not giving up on the Syrian people and we are not abandoning the pursuit of peace,” Kerry said in a speech in Brussels. Watch What Else Is Making News “We will continue to pursue a meaningful, sustainable, enforceable cessation of hostilities throughout the country – and that includes the grounding of Syrian and Russian combat aircraft in designated areas.” Kerry accused Russia of turning a blind eye to Assad’s use of chlorine gas and barrel bombs and suggested it was pursuing a scorched earth policy in place of diplomacy. “As we know, this tragic war has been made worse by the utter depravity of the regime, that doesn’t hesistate to still use gas, chlorine, mixed with other ingredients to kill its citizens, that drops barrel bombs on hospitals and children and women,” he said. “You also have the irresponsible and profoundly ill-advised decision by Russia to associate its interests and reputation with that of Assad, a man who has been responsible for torturing more than ten thousand people.” He said that if Russia was serious about peace, it would have to behave differently than it was now in Syria. “Russia knows exactly what it needs to do in order to get that cessation implemented and in a fair and reasonable way,” he said. Kerry said all parties had a duty to enable delivery of humanitarian assistance. European foreign ministers will meet on Oct. 17 to discuss what they can do to help bring peace, after the European Union proposed a new humanitarian plan at the weekend in coordination with the United Nations for the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo. But a senior European diplomat said there was little chance that Russia would change strategy, asserting that Moscow was resorting to the same tactics it used on the Chechen capital Grozny, which was devastated in 1994-96 and 1999-2000 wars by Russian forces intent on keeping Chechnya in Russia. “Their objective is the total destruction of the opposition. They have a Chechen vision of the conflict. Their method is submission by force,” the senior diplomat said. MILITARY OPTIONSRussian news agencies, citing Kerry’s Syria interlocutor, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would continue to make efforts to resolve the Syria crisis despite the US suspension of the talks. A spokeswoman for UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura said he was in “intensive consultations” on the way forward. The end of the talks could trigger deeper US consideration of military options such as providing more sophisticated arms, logistical support, and training to rebel groups. But the speed with which the ceasefire collapsed – after a UN aid convoy was bombed in Syria – appeared to surprise some US officials, leaving them without a clear plan on the immediate way forward. US PresidentBarack Obamahas been loath to get more deeply involved and US officials have said he is unlikely to do so with less than four months left in office. Russia said on Tuesday it had deployed an S-300 missile system to its Tartus naval base in Syria. “The missile battery is intended to ensure the safety of the naval base…It is unclear why the deployment of the S-300 caused such alarm among our Western partners,” the Defence Ministry said.","US Secretary of State John Kerry stated that efforts to end the Syrian war must continue despite the US decision to halt talks with Russia over their support for President Bashar al-Assad.

"‘Jammu ki dhadkan’ Simran Singh’s death leaves family distraught: ‘She was under work stress, looked sad on video call’","The family of Simran Singh, the Instagram influencer, actor, and former radio jockey who died by suicide at her flat in Gurgaon on December 25, say they believed “work-related stress” and depression were “weighing her down”. Speaking to The Indian Express over the phone, her father Jaswinder Singh said, “My daughter had been under work-related stress for quite some time. She often spoke to her mother and me about the stress that weighed her down.” According to police, Simran was found dead in her rented apartment in Gurugram, and her room was locked from the inside. No suicide note was found. Her mother, Sony Singh, said Simran had been on medication for depression for the last few years. Jaswinder said the family has not demanded an investigation into her death because they do not believe any foul play was involved. “She had no issues with anyone and never told us about any such thing. What she always spoke about was the work-related pressure that she felt… Therefore, we have not demanded any probe. But we have been told that the police will be investigating her death. Things will become clearer after the postmortem report.” Rubbishing speculation on social media about her alleged friendship with a YouTuber, Jaswinder said, “Social media makes all kinds of stories. It is wrong reporting, which is why we have avoided speaking to anyone in Jammu – we have not given any statement… These are all speculations.” The Gurgaon police said they had found no evidence of foul play regarding her death. “She lived in a three-storey building in Sector 47 with five-six friends. One of her friends, who lived on the same floor, was the first to find her in the room and took her to Park Hospital. From there, a call was received about her death,” police said in a statement. On December 25, Simran, who had over 7,62,000 followers on Instagram, where she described herself as “Jammu ki Dhadkan”, was supposed to return home, Jaswinder said. She had an audition scheduled for a Hindi serial in Mumbai on December 27. “And from January 1, she was supposed to start shooting for a Punjabi movie in Chandigarh… She told me that she would be coming home on December 25 and then tell us her plans for the future,” he said. Simran’s mother said she made a video call to her parents on December 24, a day before her death. “We spoke for an hour. She looked sad,” Sony Singh said. “She was articulate and would often discuss her work-related issues with me. She used to write content as well… I have seen her struggling to get the right words… She used to call me every day between 7.30 pm and 8.30 pm… During our conversations, she usually spoke very normally and was like that at home, too. But when she would lose her temper, she got really angry. She could not control her anger,” her mother said. Jaswinder said Simran started working as a radio jockey with Radio Mirchi at the age of 21. “After a couple of years, she quit in 2022. She was very popular in Jammu, and was known as Jammu Ki Dhadkan,” he said. “After quitting as RJ, she started freelancing and constantly got different offers, be it for television serials or movies. She also used to make reels – sometimes throughout the night and then sleep during the day,” said Jaswinder. According to Sony, Simran struggled to choose whether to accept roles in TV serials or wait for film roles. “She got confused because some directors told her that if she acted in serials, they wouldn’t take her in movies,” Sony said. The family said that on the night of December 24, her friends had organised a party for her as she was planning to go home to Jammu the next day. “She went to sleep at 6 in the morning, but when her friends did not hear from her by late afternoon, they knocked on the door. When there was no response, they alerted the police,” her mother said. Simran’s maternal grandfather, Joga Singh, remembered her as a “bubbly” girl from childhood. “She was a chatterbox when she was in school. After she got into college, I could sense that she wanted to achieve something big. She got the RJ’s job and made a name for herself, which was an achievement in itself at such a young age. Our entire family was proud of her,” he said. Her last rites were performed on Friday afternoon. A former colleague of hers from the time she worked as a DJ recalled, “She was vibrant and had a different kind of spark in her. She was very dedicated to her work.” She last posted a reel on Instagram on December 13, writing, “Just a girl with endless giggles and her gown, taking over the beach”. The reel showed her twirling on the beach in a peach gown. It was her reels on Instagram that shot her into the limelight more than her stint as an RJ, said another former colleague. She then moved to Chandigarh and subsequently to Gurgaon, where she started working on brand collaborations and interviews with celebrities, the colleague said. J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and his father and National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah expressed grief over Simran’s death, extending their condolences to her family, friends, and “countless fans”.","Simran Singh, an Instagram influencer, actor, and former RJ known as ""Jammu Ki Dhadkan,"" died by suicide at her Gurgaon flat on December 25.

She recently faced challenges in deciding between roles in TV serials and films. On December 24, she made a video call to her parents, where they noted she appeared sad. Simran was found unresponsive by her friends the next day after she failed to respond to their knocks. The police found no evidence of foul play, and her family has not requested an investigation.

Kohli has become the Donald Trump of world sport: Aus media,"The Australian media has made a scathing accusation on India captain Virat Kohli of being ""completely untouchable"" and ""a law unto himself"". The Daily Telegraph compared Kohli to the United States President Donald Trump, saying ""Kohli has become the Donald Trump of world sport"".This comes after Kohli accused the Australian players of trolling Team India physio Patrick Farhart during the Ranchi Test.""They (four-five of them) started taking Patrick's name. I don't know why. He's our physio. His job is to treat me. I don't find the reason behind it. I could not understand. You must ask why they have started taking his name,"" Kohli said. While saving a run on the first day of the third Test, Kohli hurt his right shoulder and Farhart rushed onto the field to attain to his injury. Kohli eventually left the field with the physio and was back in action only on the third day.Later, Glenn Maxwell was seen mocking Kohli's injury when he imitated his action by clutching his right shoulder after his dive to save a boundary. The Indian skipper, too, gave it back with a similar gesture when David Warner got out in Australia's second innings.However, Smith insisted that they never disrespected Farhart, who himself is an Australian.""Virat was having a go at me out in the middle and saying how I was disrespecting Patrick Farhart when actually it was the exact opposite. If I was to do anything, (I was inferring) he did a pretty terrific job to get Virat back on the field after that shoulder,"" Smith said.DRS SAGAThe Kohli-Smith quarrel started in Bengaluru over a DRS incident when the Australian captain was caught seeking help from his team's dressing room over a review after he was trapped leg before by Umesh Yadav.While Smith called it a ""brain fade"", Kohli warned the visitors of ""crossing the line"". International Cricket Council put an end to the saga by not pressing charges against Smith or Kohli.""Test captains, under the rules of the game, are supposed to be the flagbearers for upholding the spirit of the game, yet the ICC has allowed the Indian captain to destroy one of the foundations on which the game has been played for more than a century,"" The Daily Telegraph wrote.""The fact Kohli has not been sanctioned for calling the Australians systematic cheats or his latest unfounded attack on Smith shows that he is completely untouchable.""""The ICC won't fine him. Not even the BCCI, who through their broadcaster apologised to Smith, can get their skipper to tow the party line.""'KOHLI DISRESPECTS GAME'The report further compared Kohli to Arjuna Ranatunga for showing no respect to his opponent.""Like former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga, Kohli relies on a flagrant disrespect of his opponents and the game to fuel himself and his team.Soft cricketing administrators have given rise to a bat-wielding Trump.""'KOHLI, AUSTRALIA'S NO.1 ENEMY'There's no doubt that Australian fans hate Kohli.

Inquiry report on charges against lawyer submitted to State Police Chief,"District Police Chief (Kochi City) K. Sethuraman on Saturday submitted to the State Police Chief (SPC) an inquiry report into allegations against a High Court lawyer that he had fleeced his clients on the pretext of bribing judges. He was asked to conduct an inquiry and submit a report by the SPC on January 15. This was after the High Court Vigilance wing submitted a report to the High Court Registrar after conducting a probe on allegations against the lawyer. “My job is to file a subjective and unbiased report to the SPC,” Mr. Sethuramam told the media in the morning without divulging the content of the report. The report was submitted after recording the statements of all parties concerned, including the lawyer. Though he initially did not turn up as directed, his statement was eventually recorded on Wednesday when he insisted that the amount collected from his clients was towards his fees and not meant as bribes to be paid to judges. The report is likely to form the basis of whether or not to register a case. It was alleged that the lawyer had taken lakhs of rupees from clients by falsely claiming that it was meant as bribe for judges.","District Police Chief K.

Despite initially evading the inquiry, the lawyer eventually provided his statement, contending that the funds obtained from clients were legal fees, not bribes for judges.

Rebels hunt for Gaddafi in Tripoli,"Muammar Gaddafi was a hunted man today as loyal remnants of his forces made a last-ditch stand in the capital and world leaders embraced the fractious Libyan rebels as new masters of the oil-rich North African state. Nearly 48 hours after a pincer thrust on Tripoli by the irregular rebel armies, launched in tandem with an uprising in the city, Gaddafi’s tanks and sharpshooters appeared to hold only small areas, including his Bab al-Aziziya headquarters. Civilians, who mobbed the streets late on Sunday to cheer the end of dictatorship, stayed indoors as gunfire crackled. Gaddafi’s prime minister showed up in Tunisia. State television went off the air and rebels said they had seized its transmitters. More Libyan embassies abroad hoisted the rebel flag. Western powers who deployed air power in support of various rebel groups in different regions, urged the “Brother Leader” to accept his 42 years of absolute power were over, and to end the bloodshed after six months of civil war that has ebbed and flowed erratically across the sparsely populated desert nation. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who took an early gamble on the Libyan rebels, called on Gaddafi loyalists “to turn their back on the criminal and cynical blindness of their leader by immediately ceasing fire, giving up their arms and turning themselves into the legitimate Libyan authorities”. US President Barack Obama said: “Muammar Gaddafi and his regime need to recognise that their rule has come to an end.” Egypt, whose Arab Spring revolt inspired its neighbours, abandoned its caution and recognised the rebel government. Other beleaguered Arab revolutionaries, notably in Syria, may take heart from a hard-fought triumph in the sands of Libya. Laila Jawad, 36, who works at a Tripoli nursery, told Reuters after the rebels swept into the city: “We are about to be delivered from the tyrant’s rule. It’s a new thing for me. I am very optimistic.” With international competition already heating up for Libyan oil, Russia and China, critics of the West’s assault on Gaddafi, also indicated he should bow to the now inevitable. But after a defiant audio address on Sunday, urging citizens to take up arms against rebel “rats”, no more was heard from a man who is one of the world’s longest ruling leaders and who vowed do die fighting rather than surrender. Various officials said they did not know where he was. Two of Gaddafi’s sons were detained, including Saif al-Islam who has been indicted with his father for crimes against humanity. Two other sons, Khamis and Mutassim, were reported by Arab media to be with those still fighting. Gaddafi’s prime minister, Al Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi, arrived late on Sunday on the Tunisian island of Djerba, a favoured location for defectors and negotiators from Tripoli. Local sources could give no account of what he was doing there. A rebel official in the eastern city of Benghazi, seat of the opposition National Transitional Council, said some of its representatives had slipped in to Tripoli in recent days to make contact with authorities hitherto loyal to Gaddafi with the aim of averting a breakdown of order in the capital. Civilians had flocked late on Sunday to Green Square, long the showpiece of the leader’s personality cult, waving rebel flags. Some said they would rename it Martyrs’ Square. Young men burned the green flags of the government and raised the rebel tricolour last used by the post-colonial monarchy which Gaddafi overthrew in a military coup in 1969.","As rebel forces closed in on Tripoli, Muammar Gaddafi became a fugitive with his regime collapsing after 42 years. Celebrations erupted, but fighting continued near his compound. World leaders backed the rebels, urging Gaddafi to surrender. Some of his sons were captured, while others remained at large. His whereabouts were unknown.",International News,2011-08-23 00:00:00

‘4 or 5 hits dene se yeh Bollywood ke baap nahi bane na banenge’: Sanjay Gupta launches tirade against Naga Vamsi’s ‘obnoxious’ behaviour,"Who’d have thought 2024 would be the year when the ‘Indian cinema’ bubble starts bursting in the seams? In a year when Pushpa 2: The Rule, a Telugu film, became the highest grossing Hindi film in India… ever, there were feathers bound to be ruffled. And the first steps of it happened at a Galatta Plus roundtable when Telugu producer Naga Vamsi asserted to Boney Kapoor that it is time Hindi cinema moves away from ‘Bandra and Juhu’ and how ‘We have changed the way you (Hindi cinema) look at cinema.’ This statement and his demeanour during the interaction, which also featured filmmakers like Archana Kalpathi, Siddharth, Don Palathara and Chandini Sasha, didn’t go down well with a lot of people, including filmmaker Sanjay Gupta. The Kaante filmmaker launched a tirade against Vamsi, and took to social media to establish his derision. He wrote, “Who is this obnoxious guy sitting next to a senior producer like Boney Ji and deriding him with his fake vanity? Look at his body language and disgusting attitude. 4/5 hits dene se yeh Bollywood ke baap nahin bane na banenge (You won’t become Bollywood’s father by delivering a few hits).” ALSO READ: Boney Kapoor and Naga Vamsi argue over regional cinema’s influence on Bollywood: ‘You were stuck making films for Bandra and Juhu’ Who is this obnoxious guy sitting next to a senior producer like Boney Ji and deriding him with his fake vanity?

Gupta wrote, “Would he have the guts to sit in front of senior Producers like Allu Arvind Sir or Suresh Babu Sir and speak to them in this manner pointing his fingers in their face. Learn to value RESPECT before SUCCESS.” He also spoke in praise of South cinema producers who were always the picture of ‘humility and discipline’. “The first thing we learnt working with the great Southern Film Producers was HUMILITY and DISCIPLINE. An obnoxious show of arrogance is the very last thing you would expect from them.” Would he have the guts to sit in front of senior Producers like Allu Arvind Sir or Suresh Babu Sir and speak to them in this manner pointing his fingers in their face. Learn to value RESPECT before SUCCESS. https://t.co/ec7MnctlZZ — Sanjay Gupta (@_SanjayGupta) December 31, 2024 What truly caught Boney Kapoor’s goat in the roundtable was Naga Vamsi’s insinuation that Hindi cinema hasn’t done much in the recent past, and even the big-ticket successes in Hindi had a strong South connection. Although Boney tried to point out that Hindi cinema still has a strong history, and proven track record, Vamsi tried to drive home that the tides were changing. In fact, he even said that filmmakers in Hindi cinema would have had sleepless nights after the blockbuster success of Pushpa 2, especially on the first Sunday when it made more than Rs 80 crore. Sanjay Gupta didn’t let this aside go as he quickly took to social media to respond to this jibe. He wrote, “We slept very peacefully and happily knowing that 86 Cr was collected by our exhibitors. Must be in your case, but other people’s success does not give us sleepless nights.” We slept very peacefully and happily knowing that 86 Cr was collected by our exhibitors.

Of course, there are still calls about maintaining unity, and how this is still Indian cinema.

Balancing privacy and voters’ rights,"How much about a candidate is a voter entitled to get information about? How does the right to privacy square with the right to adult franchise and the voters’ right to know? This week, the Supreme Court (SC) laid down some ground rules in this still-evolving area of jurisprudence. Adjudicating a case from Arunachal Pradesh, the top court held that a candidate’s right to privacy remains intact for matters irrelevant to voters or his/her public role, and clarified that candidates are not mandated to reveal every piece of asset owned by them or their dependents unless those items significantly influence their public image or lifestyle. Non-disclosure of each and every asset owned by a candidate would not amount to a defect, the SC held.","The Supreme Court ruled that voters are entitled to relevant information about candidates, balancing their right to privacy with voters' right to know.

City breathes easy as unseasonal rain improves air quality,"Mumbai: A day after unseasonal showers, the city breathed easy as the overall air quality index (AQI) dropped to 85 on Wednesday. On Tuesday night, several parts of Mumbai, especially the suburbs, witnessed brief spells of rain. As a result, a majority of the 25 AQI stations of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board recorded an AQI of below 100 on Wednesday. The lowest AQI was recorded in Mulund (60), followed by Kandivli (61) and Colaba (62). Across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the lowest AQI was recorded in Vasai (55).

Swachh a pity: 10 of 21 ‘smart’ toilets in Pune not operational,"Toilets are not functioning as PMC is not providing water, says MLA Siddharth Shirole With the aim of providing clean and hygienic public toilets, former Pune MP Anil Shirole, in 2018, had initiated a project for installation of state-of-the-art, automatic, smart toilet facilities in the city. Shirole spent Rs 2 crore from his MP development fund to erect 21 smart toilets in the city. However, after they were installed, 10 of the 21 smart toilets are not operational as per Right to Information (RTI) activist Abhijeet Baravkar. Baravkar who filed an RTI application seeking information regarding the smart toilets in the city said that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on February 20, confirmed that 10 toilets are not functioning. “I have been following up this issue for the past one year. A few months after the smart toilets were installed they became non-operational and are not used by the public. The ones that are operational are also not being utilised fully. On one hand the PMC is looking to rank No. 1 under the Swachh Survekshan ranking, and on the other hand the civic body is not in a position to maintain the facility,” said Baravkar. PMC solid waste management department’s executive engineer Sudhir Chavan said that he has issued a letter to the concerned contractor to repair the toilets. However, Baravkar claimed that despite the letter, none of the toilets have been repaired. Siddharth Shirole, member of legislative assembly (MLA) and son of Anil Shirole said, “It is true that some smart toilets are not operational. It is the PMC’s responsibility to carry out the maintenance of these toilets. The civic body must ensure that the concerned contractor carries out maintenance on a regular basis. Most of the smart toilets are not functioning as PMC is not providing water.” Vinay Parge, an IT employee who has used the smart toilet said, “Smart toilets are a good concept, the only problem is lack of maintenance. It is not fair to only blame the PMC, as the residents are also equally responsible. Some residents spit in the areas surrounding the toilets, in such cases the civic body is helpless.

High-octane campaign ends for opening phase,"New Delhi : A high-octane campaign for the first and largest phase of the Lok Sabha elections closed on Wednesday with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) facing off against a vast swathe of constituencies across India, two days before the world’s largest democratic exercise kicked off. A total of 102 constituencies across 21 states and Union territories will vote on Friday to determine the fates of 1,625 candidates. The first phase of the polls saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi lead the campaign for the NDA, which is aiming to win 400 Lok Sabha seats in the seven-phase polls. He addressed 40 rallies across more than a dozen states, underlining his government’s Viksit Bharat (developed India) pitch, infrastructure push and ideological goals such as the abrogation of Article 370 and construction of the Ram Temple. He also lambasted the Opposition over dynasty politics, eating meat during a month considered holy by some Hindus, and misleading the public on the plans to alter the Constitution. He spent a majority of his time in the south and the east, where critical battles in Bihar, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu will likely determine if the BJP is able to reach its goal of 370 seats. “A new atmosphere is prevailing in the entire country as we celebrate the birth anniversary of Lord Ram in his own home after 500 years and this is a culmination of centuries of devotion and generations of sacrifice,” he said at a rally in Assam, where five seats go to the polls. The INDIA response was led by a patchwork group of leaders ranging from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin. They questioned the government on unemployment and depressed wages, alleged that democracy was under threat and highlighted the incarceration of two sitting CMs – Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal and Jharkhand’s Hemant Soren. “Sometimes they will scare you and give you bundles of money. Why are you afraid every day? Who will you be afraid of? If Modi somehow wins, there will be no democracy in the country. Who will save the country?” Banerjee asked in a rally. The first phase will see all seats from Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Andaman and Nicobar, Lakshadweep and Puducherry go to the polls. The other six phases will take place over the next six weeks, with the results on June 4. Modi is seeking a historic third consecutive term, hoping to become only the second PM after Jawaharlal Nehru to achieve this feat. The largest chunk of seats will be in Tamil Nadu, where all 39 seats are going to the polls. The INDIA bloc holds 38 out of these seats and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led grouping in the state will hope for a repeat performance. Battling the ruling coalition is its traditional Dravidian rival, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, and a resurgent BJP that has put in enormous energy and resources into a state that is considered a bridge too far for the party. The AIADMK, which left the BJP alliance in 2023, targeted the DMK in the state and the BJP at the Centre for poor governance. Also in the race is Tamil nationalist S Seeman’s Naam Tamizhar Katchi (NTK) who in his fiery speeches campaigned for a corruption free Tamil Nadu. Around 61 million voters will decide the fate of 950 candidates. All five Lok Sabha seats in Uttarakhand, where the BJP and Congress are in direct contest, will also go to the polls. The BJP, which swept the state in 2014 and 2019, replaced three MPs. Modi addressed two rallies, home minister Amit Shah one, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who was born in Uttarkhand, two and Congress’s Priyanka Gandhi and Sachin Pilot covered three constituencies. The fate of 55 candidates will be decided by 16 million voters. Focus will also be on the 12 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan, where the other 13 will go to the polls in the next phase. The state will decide the fate of 131 candidates. The BJP had swept Rajasthan in 2019 and is contesting all seats. The Congress, on the other hand, is contesting 22 and left three for its alliance partners Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP). Modi visited the state five times , Rahul Gandhi twice and Congress president Malliarjun Kharge once. On the last day of the campaign in Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 members to the Lok Sabha, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav – both partners in opposition’s INDIA bloc – addressed rallies in Saharanpur and Moradabad. The seats going to polls in the first phase on Friday are Saharanpur, Bijnor, Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Nagina, Moradabad, Rampur, and Pilibhit. In Madhya Pradesh, six of the 29 Lok Sabha seats are going to polls. Among the slew of leaders who campaigned in the state, Modi addressed four rallies and Rahul Gandhi two. In Bihar, four seats are going to polls – Jamui, Nawada, Gaya and Aurangabad. Modi addressed rallies in three of the four constituencies. In fourth constituency, Aurangabad, Union home minister Amit Shah addressed a rally. All the four were won by the NDA in 2019. The INDIA bloc campaign was led by Tejaswhi Yadav of the RJD. In West Bengal, the BJP won all three seats in 2019. In the Northeast, 14 of the 25 Lok Sabha seats including five in Assam, which will go to polls. The last day of the campaign saw election rallies by Modi in Assam and Tripura, and by Banerjee in Assam’s Barak Valley. Prominent candidates who are contesting in the first phase include BJP’s former Assam chief minister and incumbent Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal (Dibrugarh), Union minister Kiren Rijiju (Arunachal West), former Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb (West Tripura), Congress’s deputy leader in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi (Jorhat) and former Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Nabam Tuki (West Arunachal).

"Incoming call ringer be set at 30 seconds, rules trai","NEW DELHI : The telecom regulator has ruled that an incoming voice call on a mobile phone must ring for at least 30 seconds, resolving the deadlock that emerged when Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel had locked horns over the matter. Operators would have to maintain the time duration of alert for an incoming voice call, which is neither answered nor rejected by the called party, to 30 seconds for cellular mobile telephone services, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said on Friday. “However, originating network may release an unanswered call after 90 seconds in case the call release message is not received from the terminating network."" While Bharti Airtel had said the ringing time be set at 45 seconds and argued that networks receiving the call must be allowed sufficient time, Jio had batted for a reduction to 20-25 seconds saying that it will save spectrum resources. Vodafone Idea wanted ringer time to be set at 30 seconds. Trai had floated a consultation paper on the matter on 16 September. Airtel, the country’s second-largest operator by revenue, had in September said it had cut the ringing time for outgoing calls to a rival network to 25 seconds from 45. This was in retaliation to its bitter rival Jio’s move. “Every second reduction on the ringing time saves spectrum resources for us,"" Mahipal Singh, associate vice-president of Jio, had said on 16 October in an open house held by the regulator. “94% calls on Jio’s network are answered within 25 seconds,"" he said, adding that the ringer time should be outside regulatory intervention. Rival Airtel, on the other hand, said the timer should be set based on the preference of the network which is receiving the phone call. “The time taken to terminate the call on a network should be uniform across networks. And the terminating or receiving network should be allowed sufficient time to answer the call. This should be 45 seconds,"" Ravi Gandhi, chief regulatory officer, Bharti Airtel, had then said. If these ringing timers are set differently by different network operators, the chances of answering the call by user of one network would be different from the user of another network as one party would get more time to answer the call than the other party. Also, every call that lands on a mobile network fetches it money. The interconnect usage charge or IUC is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks, and is a source of revenue for telcos such as Airtel and Vodafone Idea who enjoy more incoming traffic than outgoing. At present, the IUC is at 6 paise a minute. Interestingly, Jio, which reduced its outgoing call ringer time to 25 seconds, has more outgoing traffic than incoming. Jio’s outgoing traffic was 64% of its total voice traffic as of June end. Airtel had alleged in September that with Jio reducing its outgoing call ringing time, the change in pattern results in a missed call, and forces the call receiver on the rival network to dial back and, hence, create incoming call traffic for Jio. Jio, however, has argued that globally, most operators have an average ringing time of only 15-20 seconds, and 25 seconds ringing time on Jio network is in line with global practice. The ringing time also impacts network efficiency. The maximum time allowed to answer the call takes on more importance as the alerting phase also engages scarce radio spectrum resources. Ringing for a long time, when a user is unlikely to accept the phone call, would led to non-optimal utilization of resources. The reverse also has implications. Configuring duration of ringing time on lower side might save resources but may leaf to concerns over network performance, if duration is much lower than the typical time one takes to answer the call.","The telecom regulator in India has ruled that an incoming voice call on a mobile phone must ring for at least 30 seconds, resolving a deadlock between Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel.

Pawar hits out at Uddhav govt on Elgar case handover to NIA,"Mumbai : Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar on Friday expressed unhappiness over chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to hand over the Elgar Parishad case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the first time the senior leader has criticised his alliance partner in the state’s ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, formed in November last year. Pawar said that while the central government’s decision directing NIA to take over the Elgar Parishad case was unfair, the state government’s acceptance of this was even more unfair. To be sure, the NIA Act, passed hurriedly in the wake of the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008, has provisions that give the Centre the powers to ask NIA to take over a case. Thackeray’s decision, which came on Thursday, clears the deck for NIA to start investigating the case against activists and intellectuals linked to Left and Dalit movements, who gave speeches at the Elgar Parishad gathering on December 31, 2017. It is alleged that these speeches resulted in the subsequent violence at Bhima Koregaon. “Maintaining law and order is a state subject and the Centre’s encroachment in state affairs is unfair. Centre’s decision directing the NIA to take over Elgar Parishad case was unfair but the state government’s approval to that decision is more unfair,” Pawar told reporters in Kolhapur at a press conference. While the government has shied away from using provisions of the NIA Act that allow the Centre to ask the agency to take over a case, without seeking the permission of the concerned state government, the fact is that these provisions exist. The NCP would appear to be distancing itself from the decision of the government of which it is a part. On Thursday, state home minister Anil Deshmukh,
