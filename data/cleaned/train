Palestinian teen injures two in a new gun attack in east Jerusalem,"A 13-year-old Palestinian opened fire in east Jerusalem on Saturday, January 28, 2023, wounding two Israelis, officials said, a day after another attacker killed seven outside a synagogue in the deadliest attack in the city since 2008. The shooting in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan in east Jerusalem, near the historic Old City, wounded a father and son, ages 47 and 23, paramedics said. Both were fully conscious and in moderate to serious condition in the hospital, the medics added. As police rushed to the scene, two passers-by with licensed weapons shot and overpowered the 13-year-old attacker, police said. Police confiscated his handgun and took the wounded teen to a hospital. Video showed police escorting a wounded teen, wearing nothing but underwear, away from the scene and onto a stretcher, his hands cuffed behind his back. Authorities taped off the street, emergency vehicles and security forces swarmed the area and helicopters whirled overhead. “He waited to ambush civilians on the holy Sabbath day,” Israeli police spokesman Dean Elsdunne told The Associated Press, adding that the teenager opened fire on a group of five civilians. Security footage showed the victims to be observant Jews, wearing skullcaps and tzitzit, or knotted ritual tassels. Saturday's events — on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's arrival in the region — raised the possibility of even greater conflagration in one of the bloodiest months in Israel and the occupied West Bank in several years. On Friday, a Palestinian gunman killed at least seven people, including a 70-year-old woman, in a Jewish settlement in east Jerusalem, an area captured by Israel in 1967 and later annexed in a move not internationally recognized. Attack a challenge to National Security The attacks pose pivotal test for Israel’s new far-right government. Its firebrand Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has presented himself as an enforcer of law and order and grabbed headlines for his promises to take even stronger action against the Palestinians. Speaking to reporters at a hospital where victims were being treated, Ben-Gvir said he wants homes of Palestinian attackers sealed off immediately as a punitive measure, lashing out at Israel's attorney general for delaying his order. She “is not allowing us to seal the house. In my opinion this is awful. In my opinion, it can’t be like that,” he said of the top prosecutor. He also called for demolishing dozens of Palestinian homes that Israel says were illegally built in east Jerusalem, granting more gun licenses to Israelis, and applying the death penalty on Palestinians convicted of killing Israelis. Overhauling the justice system in the country, including the attorney general's, has been on the top agenda of the new government, which says judges have overwhelming powers. The divisive issue helped fuel weekly protests by Israelis who say the sweeping proposed changes would weaken the Supreme Court and undermine democracy. The Israeli army said it had deployed another battalion to the West Bank on Saturday, adding hundreds more troops to a presence already on heightened alert in the occupied territory. In the Jenin refugee camp, the site of a deadly Israeli military raid on Thursday that fueled the latest escalation, footage showed Palestinians dancing and cheering in celebration of the shooting on Saturday. Palestinian detainees who celebrated in prison after Friday's attack were placed in solitary confinement, the Israeli prison service said. Prime Minister Netanyahu said he would convene his Security Cabinet later, after the Sabbath, which ends at sundown, to discuss a further response to the attack near the synagogue. Security forces launched a crackdown in east Jerusalem, fanning out into the neighborhood of the 21-year-old Palestinian gunman, who was shot and killed at the scene. Police arrested 42 of his family members and neighbors for questioning in the At-Tur neighborhood. The Palestinian leadership, meanwhile, upheld its decision to halt security coordination with Israel that was taken Thursday following the deadly raid in Jenin. After a meeting headed by President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority called on international community and the U.S. administration to oblige Israel into stopping its raids and operations in the West Bank. Police Chief Kobi Shabtai permanently moved a force, similar to a S.W.A.T. team, in the city and beefed up forces, instructing police to work 12-hour shifts. He urged the public to call a hotline if they see anything suspicious. The earlier Friday attack came a day after an Israeli military raid killed nine Palestinians in the flashpoint Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank that prompted a rocket barrage from Gaza and retaliatory Israeli airstrikes. Although calm had appeared to take hold after the limited exchange of fire between Israel and Gaza militants, tensions were running high in Jerusalem and the West Bank. Thursday's raid, deadliest single incursion in the West Bank since 2002, followed a particularly bloody month that saw at least 30 Palestinians — militants and civilians — killed in in confrontations with Israelis in the West Bank, according to a tally by the AP. Last year, as the Israeli military intensified its arrest raids following a string of deadly Palestinian attacks within Israel, at least 150 Palestinians were killed in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem. It was the highest annual death toll for more than a decade and a half. Thirty people were killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis last year. Israel says most of the dead were militants. But youths protesting the incursions and others not involved in the confrontations also have been killed. The Israeli military contends its raids are meant to dismantle militant networks and thwart attacks. But Palestinians say they further entrench Israel’s 55-year, open-ended occupation of the West Bank, captured along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians demand east Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state, and much of the world considers it illegally occupied. Israel claims as its united, sovereign capital. Palestinians also say the building of Jewish settlements in those territories threatens the prospect of a viable, contiguous future state. Home to the shrines of all three major monotheistic religions, the contested capital been the centerpiece of spiking tensions between Israelis and Palestinians for years. Both Palestinian attackers behind the shootings on Friday and Saturday came from east Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of east Jerusalem hold permanent residency status, allowing them to work and move freely throughout Israel, but they are not allowed to vote in national elections. Residency rights can be stripped if a Palestinian is found to live outside the city for an extended period or in certain security cases. Although their standard of living is generally better than in the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian residents of the city receive a fraction of the services that Jewish residents do. They also complain of home demolitions and the near impossibility of obtaining Israeli building permits.","A 13-year-old Palestinian opened fire in east Jerusalem on Saturday, January 28, 2023, wounding two Israelis, officials said, a day after another attacker killed seven outside a synagogue in the deadliest attack in the city since 2008.

Trudeau accuses India of promoting violence in Canada: Reports,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has accused the Indian government of orchestrating violence in Canada, specifically targeting Sikh separatists. During an inquiry on foreign interference, Trudeau claimed that India violated Canada's sovereignty by targeting Sikh dissidents, calling it a ""horrific mistake.""

Stephanie Hsu on Laid: 'It was fun to tell a love story for our times',"An adaptation of an Australian show of the same name, the new series is currently streaming on JioCinema Premium in India. Hollywood star Stephanie Hsu, best known to international audiences for her role in Oscar-winning ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"", says her latest comedy series ""Laid"" is modelled on traditional rom-coms but has a ""weird angle"" that speaks to today's audiences. Hsu plays the role of Ruby Yao, a 33-year-old single Seattle-based party planner who is trying to solve why her former partners are dying in the order she slept with them. For the actor, it was a no-brainer to be a part of the series, which is an adaptation of an Australian show of the same name. ""I love comedy so much. I started in sketch comedy and it's so fun to be on a set and be silly and make each other laugh. So it was kind of a no-brainer to have a good time and make this show. Obviously this is a very extreme version and twisted version of that but it was really fun to get to tell a love story for our times,"" Hsu told PTI in an interview. The actor, who also starred in Prime Video's ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"", said she was craving to be a part of a love story that would ""speak to the time that we're in now"". ""I do have this theory that we haven't had... we are not in the golden age of rom coms because the way people come to love and the way people find relationships is so different. And I think that maybe we're not as rosy-eyed as we were in the nineties,"" she said. ""Our show is a twisted way of thinking about everyone you've ever been with... Like, when we want to watch the feel good rom coms, we like head to Nora Ephron, but for something to feel really new and fresh and appropriate to what it feels like in modern day dating, I think you need like a fun, weird angle, which our show definitely has,"" Hsu added. Nahnatchka Khan of ""Always Be My Maybe"" fame and Sally Bradford McKenna have developed the series, which currently streams on JioCinema Premium in India. Actor Zosia Mamet, who essays the role of AJ, Ruby's best friend and roommate, said she had a blast playing the character and finding her story. ""Natnachka and Sally did such an amazing job of creating this person who, on the surface, seems to really march to the beat of her own drum, and doesn't necessarily care what other people think, and she maybe has these bizarre fringe interests. ""But as the season progresses, and maybe as Ruby sort of plays with her heart a little bit, this vulnerable person emerges from inside, and I thought that that was a really fun arc to play around with,"" she said. ""Laid"", produced by Universal Television, also stars Michael Angarano, Tommy Martinez and Olivia Holt in pivotal roles.","Stephanie Hsu, known for her Oscar-nominated role in Everything Everywhere All at Once, stars in the new comedy series Laid, now streaming on JioCinema Premium in India.

Bride bazaar flourishes in Hyderabad,"A “bride bazaar” is thriving on a well-oiled network of unscrupulous qazis (priests) and agents who exploit the poverty and illiteracy of Muslim families and push young girls into a life of hell. The unearthing of a contract-marriage racket in the old city area of Hyderabad recently, involving foreigners buying young brides for sexual exploitation, has come as a grim reminder of a flourishing trade through sham marriages. The police busted the racket and arrested six persons, including two qazis, two Sudanese students and two women brokers. The modus operandi of the operators has exposed chinks in the monitoring set-up of the government agencies and the state Wakf Board. The agents used to identify minor girls from poor families of old city, lured them with money and promise of a prosperous life in a faraway land and sold them off to foreigners with the help of qazis who “performed” marriage using fabricated documents. At the end of it, it was the minor girls from poor families who became victims of exploitation. In the recent case, a 25-year-old Sudan national Mohammed Ansari, who is on a student visa, “married” a 16-year-old girl by paying Rs 50,000 to brokers. The girl’s mother is a poor widow with five daughters and hardly any source of income. After suffering two weeks of sexual abuse by her “husband” and also his friend, another Sudanese student, the young bride managed to run away and sought police protection. At least seven more such incidents were reported in old city in recent past involving Sudanese and Somalians, suggesting existence of a contract-marriage racket, exploiting poor Muslim women, Deputy Commissioner of Police Vineet Brijlal said. Many cases went unreported, he added. Investigation revealed that the young bride was made to sign a blank piece of paper that was intended to be later used as a “khulanama” or a declaration of divorce. With this, she would not be entitled to alimony or other rights. The foreigner bridegrooms would leave after the expiry of their student visa. “After arriving here on student visas, these Sudanese nationals trap poor girls into marriage, use them, and when they leave, they already have a divorce paper ready in hand, so they can go scot free,” the police official said. The police has registered a case of rape, abduction of minor for marriage, outraging modesty and also a case under the Immoral Trafficking Act. Muslim intellectuals have suggested a series of measures to prevent exploitation of girls in the name of marriages. “The Wakf Board should be given more powers. The archaic qazi Act should be replaced by a comprehensive act that takes into account the changing needs of the Muslims. A sustained effort must be made to promote education, vocational training and employment of the girl child,” senior analyst Mir Ayoob Ali Khan said.","A contract-marriage racket, or ""bride bazaar,"" has been discovered in Hyderabad, exposing a network of unscrupulous qazis and agents exploiting poverty and illiteracy in Muslim families.

"George cleared VIP planes for Justice Phukan, says Pranab","New Delhi, May 4 Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the Justice S.N. Phukan Commission, probing defence deals, had not only visited Pune and Ahmednagar but also Ajanta and Ellora in 2003, going against the prescribed rules for use of IAF’s VIP aircraft. Responding to clarifications in the Rajya Sabha, after he made identical statements in the two Houses, Mr Mukherjee said he was not passing any value judgement about use of service aircraft for carrying the Commission. “It is not for me to sit on judgement but for people to see. I am duty-bound to give the factual position,” he said. Mr Mukherjee said some members had stated in the House that an investigating agency or commission does not take hospitality of persons whose role was being probed. Describing reflections made on Justice Venkatswami, who was earlier probing the Tehelka expose, as “unfortunate,” the Minister said “we should be careful while making reflections.” He said Justice Venkatswami resigned from the Tehelka Commission of Inquiry immediately after the “unfortunate” reflections were made. Mr Mukherjee said Justice Phukan Commission was not given an extension after it was found that it was taking “unusual time.” He said the entire Tehelka matter had been referred to the CBI. Mr Mukherjee said report of a news magazine about the VIP aircraft having been used to carry Justice Phukan Commision was “factually correct.” He said Commission, looking into 14 items related to the Ministry of Defence, had availed the facility on being allowed by the then Defence Minister. He said the instructions regarding the use of the VIP aircraft by the Phukan Commission were issued by the Defence Ministry after a request in this regard was approved on December 22, 2003 by then Defence Minister George Fernandes. In view of Justice Phukan’s visit to Pune, Ahmednagar, Mumbai and Bangalore along with eight other officials and members of the Commission, to inspect the items, the order was issued to Service Headquarters and officers concerned in the Ministry of Defence on December 16, 2003, Mr Mukherjee said. A request was then made to Service Headquarters to prepare a detailed programme and to send it to the Ministry by December 19, 2003. Air Headquarters moved the Joint Secretary (G/Air) on December 17 to seek the approval of the then Defence Minister for providing the service aircraft. Justice Phukan along with his wife and eight officers undertook the visit by the Service Aircraft (AVRO) to Pune and from there visited Ahmednagar by an IAF chopper. They also visited Ajanta and Ellora, he said. He said the Commission did not include experts in its visit to various places where defence equipment was to be inspected. The journey from Pune to Mumbai was made by an IL-76 transport aircraft, Mr Mukherjee said. The Commission visited the Shirdi Shrine from Ahmednagar on December 24, 2003, by road, the Minister added. He said the Commission had used the aircraft which the President, Prime Minister and Vice President were entitled to use. He said some other dignitaries, including the Defence Minister and Home Minister, were also entitled to use the VIP aircraft, if it was essential and if the plane was available. “It is expected that except the President, the Vice-President and the Prime Minister, other users will use the commercial services on official duty, wherever possible,” he said. Pointing out that entitled persons had to pay for the use if the journey was not for defence purposes, he said the Congress had paid Rs 5 crore for use of the VIP aircraft by the Prime Minister. He said it was to be examined who will pay for the use of aircraft for carrying Justice Phukan and officers of the commission. “There are a lot of issues about which we are not very clear. It appears as if something was to be done in a hurry,” Mr Mukherjee said. He said the Ministry of Personnel, which had appointed the Commission, was paying salaries while other expenses had to be borne by the Defence Ministry. Earlier, Rajya Sabha members from the Congress and the Left parties demanded that the report of the Phukan Commission be rejected since it had lost credibility.","Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee revealed that the Justice S.N. Phukan Commission, investigating defence deals, violated prescribed rules by using IAF's VIP aircraft for non-essential visits to places like Ajanta and Ellora in 2003. Mukherjee clarified he wasn't passing judgment but providing facts. The Commission's extended duration led to its non-extension, and Mukherjee noted the correct reporting of VIP aircraft use. He emphasized that dignitaries, apart from the top leaders, should use commercial services when possible. Congress and Left parties in the Rajya Sabha questioned the Commission's credibility, demanding the rejection of its report.",Politics,2005-05-05 00:00:00
Iraqi Shiite militia claims rocket attack on US base in Syria,"n Iraqi Shiite militia has claimed responsibility for a rocket barrage on a US military base in Syria’s northeastern province of al-Hasakah. The militia, named Islamic Resistance in Iraq, claimed in an online statement on Tuesday that its fighters fired rockets on the al-Shaddadi military base and hit their targets, without giving further details, Xinhua news agency reported. The attack by the Iraqi armed group is part of a series of retaliatory measures against the US forces amid the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip, the group’s statement added. Advertisement Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, confirmed that explosions were heard in the al-Shaddadi base. There are no reports of casualties so far. The incident marked the 61st recorded attack on the US bases in Syria since October 19, the war monitor added. Earlier in the day, the White House said that US President Joe Biden ordered the military to launch airstrikes against three locations utilized by Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups in Iraq. The order came after a drone attack on Monday on a US base near Erbil Airport in northern Iraq wounded three US service members, one critically. Later in the day, the Iraqi government condemned the US airstrikes on Iraqi security sites, which killed a security member and injured 18 people, including civilians, according to a statement by the media office of Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ al-Sudani.","An Iraqi Shiite militia, Islamic Resistance in Iraq, has claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on a US military base in Syria's al-Hasakah province.

3 wushu players from Arunachal get accreditation for Hangzhou Asian Games,"Wushu players Onilu Tega, Nyeman Wangsu and Mepung Lamgu, who were issued stapled visas by the Chinese embassy for the World University Games in July, now have the required accreditation to don the Indian jersey at the Asian Games scheduled from 23 September to 8 October in Hangzhou, China. The three wushu players from Arunachal got their accreditation from the Hangzhou Asian Games organisers, an Indian Olympic Association (IOA) official said. “Yes, the IOA has got their accreditation,” Arunachal Olympic Association secretary-general Bamang Tago said, quoting IOA joint secretary-cum-acting CEO Kalyan Chaubey as saying. Tega, Wangsu and Lamgu are among the 10-member national wushu team approved by the youth affairs & sports ministry for participation in the Asian Games. They are the only athletes from Arunachal named for the Games. In July, the trio was issued stapled visas by the Chinese embassy, which led to the pulling out of the entire team from the World University Games in Chengdu. In the past, China had resorted to issuing stapled visas to athletes from Arunachal, leading to their exclusion from competitions. The practice of issuing stapled visas is a part of China’s ongoing territorial disputes with India over Arunachal. The stapled visas are considered valid by China, but India refuses to accept the papers as legitimate travel documents. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Pema Khandu expressed happiness after the trio got the accreditation from the Games organisers. “Elated to know that three Wushu players from Arunachal Pradesh, who were earlier issued stapled visas from the Chinese embassy for the World University Games, have got their accreditation from Hangzhou Asian Games organizers.” “My heartfelt wishes and support go out to Nyeman Wangsu, Onilu Tega & Mepung Lamgu………. Go and bring glory and pride to the nation,” Khandu wrote in his X handle. The AOA also congratulated the athletes and expressed hope that they would make the nation proud by winning medals on the global stage. A total of 634 athletes have been approved for participation in the Games by the youth affairs & sports ministry. The team comprises 320 men and 314 women athletes.","Three wushu players from Arunachal Pradesh—Onilu Tega, Nyeman Wangsu, and Mepung Lamgu—have received accreditation from the Hangzhou Asian Games organizers to participate in the Asian Games scheduled from September 23 to October 8 in China.

Pakistan have a very good chance of winning T20 World Cup: Shoaib Malik,"Veteran Pakistan all-rounder Shoaib Malik feels that his national team has a very good chance of winning the T20 World Cup scheduled to be played later this year in Australia if everything goes as per the original schedule. There is no clarity on whether the marquee event will happen as planned because of the ongoing coronavirus crisis. Shoiab, who was part of the T20 World Cup-winning Pakistan squad in 2009, said that the Men in Green have a good bowling unit which is what makes them one of the favourites to lift the title. “I believe our chances are very good,” Shoaib told PakPassion. “In order to win these kinds of events, you have to have a very strong bowling attack and I think we have that box ticked. In addition, we also have a good batting line-up to complement that strong bowling attack.” “Not only that, but our fielding has also developed and improved over the years, which is important on big grounds. “Our fitness is much improved and better than it was in previous years, so overall, I think we will be right up there as a team that stands a very good chance of winning this tournament if it goes ahead,” he added. Shoaib is part of the 29 member Pakistan sqaud which will travel to England in July for a series comprising of three Tests and as many T20Is. “Of course, we all like to see packed stadiums and matches that have a buzz from the crowd, which all adds to the spectacle. But right now, the situation around the world is very concerning and we must do what is right for everyone’s health and safety,” he said. “Hopefully one day and not too far into the future crowds will be back. But for now, cricket needs to be played and if this is what needs to be done to get cricket back on then we must support it and accept it.”","Veteran Pakistan all-rounder Shoaib Malik is optimistic about his team's chances in the T20 World Cup if it proceeds as scheduled.

Recounting the past, Khandu informed that the demand for Bichom district originated in 1984, however, it came officially to the fore after formation of the Bichom District Demand Committee in 1996 under the chairmanship of Kiren Rijiju, who hails from Nafra. “While Bichom district issue kept pending, we created four new districts elsewhere.

What happens to your body when you drink hot chocolate every day?,"On our quest to find out what happens to our body in different circumstances like havingonly fruits for 72 hours, or havingavocado every day, or rice every day, we thought why not explore something as rudimentary but flavourful as a winter favourite — hot chocolate — a combination ofcocoaand milk (can be made vegan too!) with your choice of sweetener. Winter is the perfect time to cozy up with a cup of hot chocolate. For many people, hot chocolate is the ultimate comfort food. It is warm, creamy, and chocolatey, and it can be enjoyed in so many ways. Drinkinghot chocolatedaily during the winter can elicit both favorable and potential adverse impacts on your health. This delectable and soothing beverage carries profound effects, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of its daily consumption’s physiological consequences. 1. Enhanced mood:Hot chocolate boasts the presence of compounds such as theobromine and phenylethylamine. “These elements can potentiallyelevate moodby stimulating the release of endorphins, fostering feelings of contentment and overall well-being,” said Amreen Shaikh, head dietitian,WockhardtHospitals,MumbaiCentral. 2. Antioxidant advantages:The primary ingredient in hot chocolate, cocoa, harbours a wealth of antioxidants known as flavonoids. “These potent compounds combat free radicals, thereby potentially mitigating therisk of chronic ailmentsand bolstering heart health,” said Amreen. 3. Nutrient enrichment:Hot chocolate derived from dark cocoa or high-quality cocoa powder serves as a valuable source of essential minerals like magnesium, iron, and potassium. This contributes significantly to overall nutrient intake and sustenance of bodily functions. 4. Comforting warmth:Amidst the frigid winter months, the warmth exuded by this beverage offers solace and a sense of coziness, positively influencing mental well-being and emotional equilibrium. 1. Caloric and sugary content:Numerous commercially available hot chocolate mixes and prepared versions teem withexcessive sugar and calories. “Regular indulgence in such varieties may precipitate weight gain and heighten susceptibility to conditions like diabetes,” said Amreen. Several studies have discovered that chocolate contains anti-inflammatory flavonoids as well as mood-elevating flavonoids. Cocoa is made from the pod of the cacao plant, which contains theobromine, a chemical that reduces inflammation and may lower blood pressure. “Thus, opt for healthy cup of hot chocolate during winter would be better but be sure to drink it in moderation as chocolate itself contains sugar and saturated fat,” added Rishika Meetu, dietician, Bhatia Hospital, Mumbai. 2. Caffeine composition:Thoughhot chocolatetypically contains less caffeine than coffee, it still harbours a modest quantity. According to Amreen, excessive intake might disrupt sleep patterns, elevate heart rate, or induce jitteriness in individuals sensitive to caffeine. 3. Digestive challenges:Certain preparations of hot chocolate, owing to their richness and high-fat content, can trigger “digestive discomfort, particularly in individuals grappling with lactose intolerance or other sensitivities”. 4. Additives and processing:Packaged hot chocolate mixes frequently feature additives, preservatives, and artificial flavours. Amreen said that these constituents might undermine overall health when regularly consumed. Embracing hot chocolate in moderation can seamlessly integrate it into a well-rounded diet without pronounced adverse effects. “Crafting homemade versions employing quality cocoa powder, limitedsugar, and non-dairy milk alternatives can offset potential negative consequences,” said Amreen.

Wheat farming with minimum tillage,"TILLAGE which is mainly associated with ploughing has been a major farm activity for raising crops. It is manipulation of soil by ploughs, cultivators, harrows and other implements to make it loose and fine. A fine seed-bed helps germination of seeds, in addition to weed control, better aeration, moisture conservation and incorporation of biomass and crop residues.Farms are invariably well equipped with costly implements for the purpose. In the past, farmers and farm scientists have emphasised on heavy tillage for successful farming. This operation is now being mostly powered by agricultural tractors numbering around 1.7 million in India. The number of tractors is rising by about two lakh per year in the country. These machines are fuelled with hydrocarbons mainly diesel.The cost of diesel and mobile oil is rising. These hydrocarbons will last at the most next 30 to 50 years. In such conditions it becomes very important to minimise their expenditure by reducing tillage. The availability of herbicides and the motive of reducing the cost of production has provided enough incentive to the researchers in the past couple of decades to investigate the tillage operation more closely. Most of the work has been done in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, India, China and some other countries of Africa and South America.","Tillage, traditionally associated with ploughing, plays a crucial role in crop cultivation by manipulating soil to create an optimal seed-bed. It facilitates seed germination, weed control, aeration, moisture conservation, and the incorporation of biomass and crop residues. Farming operations heavily rely on costly implements like ploughs, cultivators, and harrows, often powered by agricultural tractors. However, the increasing costs of diesel and other hydrocarbons, coupled with their finite availability lasting only for the next few decades, necessitate a reduction in tillage to minimize expenses. Consequently, researchers have intensified efforts to explore alternative methods, spurred by the availability of herbicides and the objective of cost reduction in production. Significant research on tillage operations has been conducted globally, with notable contributions from countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, India, China, and several nations in Africa and South America. This collective endeavor aims to optimize farming practices while addressing economic and environmental challenges posed by reliance on conventional tillage methods.",farming,1998-11-18 00:00:00
Retirement planning: Leveraging mutual funds for a secure future,"You might not be able to beat inflation by simply relying on the returns of traditional investment avenues. People in India have finally started recognising the importance of retirement planning. Facing financial challenges post-retirement can get tricky, which is why you need to focus on creating wealth for retirement early on. One of the biggest challenges in retirement planning is saving less than what is required to live a comfortable life once you stop working. You might not be able to beat inflation by simply relying on the returns of traditional investment avenues. This is why you need to consider investing in mutual funds to work towards achieving your desired retirement goal. Understanding retirement mutual funds What are retirement mutual funds? Retirement mutual funds, also known as pension funds, aim to provide a regular income to investors after they reach the age of 55 or 60 years. Usually, pension payments start from age 55-60 years and continue till the investor’s demise. The remaining sum is then transferred to the nominee. Retirement mutual funds are pension funds that typically invest in debt instruments such as corporate bonds, government securities, and money market instruments. Some retirement funds also invest in equity-related instruments. Do note that retirement funds usually include a lock-in period of 5 years or until the investor’s retirement. The investment cannot be withdrawn during this period. Types of retirement mutual funds Large-cap mutual funds: Large-cap mutual funds primarily invest in the stocks of large-cap companies and are suitable for stability and long-term growth. Mid-cap mutual funds: These funds invest in the stocks of mid-sized companies aiming to strike a balance between growth potential and risk. Balanced funds: These funds are also known as hybrid funds, investing in a combination of stocks and bonds. These funds aim to establish a mix of income and capital appreciation. Debt funds: Debt funds are mutual fund schemes investing in fixed-income instruments such as corporate debt securities, money market instruments, government bonds, etc. The goal of these funds is to offer a regular income while minimising risk. Benefits of mutual funds in retirement planning Diversification Being able to maintain a diversified portfolio is one of the key benefits of investing in mutual funds. By investing in a mutual fund, the money is spread across various investments. This helps in reducing your dependence on a single asset’s performance. This diversification provides assurance by mitigating the risks involved with market volatility. Your retirement savings would not be entirely susceptible to the fluctuations of a single stock since the investment is spread out across various asset classes and different sectors. Professional management You do not have to worry about being a mutual fund expert. Your mutual fund investments are managed by investment professionals who have years of experience under their belt. These fund managers use their expertise and regularly analyse market trends and various investment opportunities, based on which they adjust the mutual fund holdings for optimising returns and managing risk. Flexibility and accessibility As a retired individual, having access to your funds is essential for dealing with any sudden expenses. Retirement mutual funds offer that accessibility, allowing you to redeem your investments on a daily basis. This way, you have the flexibility required to get the money from your investments whenever required. Selecting the right retirement mutual fund Factors to consider - Risk tolerance: Before investing in mutual funds, you should be aware of the level of risk you are ready to undertake. Choose a mutual fund that is aligned with your risk tolerance. The ultimate goal: There are several mutual funds that you can choose to invest in, so choose a fund type that matches your preferred income, capital increase, and diversity. Years remaining for retirement: If you are in the early years of your career (20-35 years), you can consider opting for a mutual fund with moderate risk levels to establish steady investment growth. If you are older, your investment approach might need to be aggressive in order to beat inflation and grow a corpus for retirement. Fees and charges: Always remember to keep an eye on the management fees, exit and entry loads, redemption charges, etc. before investing in a mutual fund. Matching funds to retirement goals Retirement mutual funds include various options to cater to your investment goals. While debt funds can provide a regular source of income, equity funds are more focused on capital appreciation. You can also choose to establish a balanced portfolio including a mix of both equity and debt instruments. Strategies for effective retirement planning using mutual funds Asset allocation strategies Strategic asset allocation The strategic asset allocation strategy includes determining your exposure to equity and debt, and then staying consistent on the ratio. This strategy requires you to rebalance your portfolio on a periodic basis based on market fluctuations to maintain the specific asset allocation. This type of strategy can be considered by investors who are seasoned and proactive. Dynamic asset allocation Dynamic asset allocation is considered to be one of the most popular strategies when it comes to handling mutual fund investments. This strategy does not focus on a fixed ratio for asset allocation but invests funds depending on market movements. As per this strategy, you would favour exposure towards equity when there is an upward market trend and shift your focus from equity to debt during a downward market trend. You can also choose to go the opposite way for buying low and selling high. Tactical asset allocation Tactical asset allocation is a flexible strategy that focuses on altering the asset allocation for cashing in when the market is favourable. You can adopt this strategy and change your ratio to make short-term capital gains. This strategy requires an ability to understand market movements for maximising returns by reallocating assets. Regular reviews and rebalancing It is of the utmost importance to regularly monitor and adjust your mutual fund investments to ensure that they are aligned with your retirement goals. Getting your portfolio rebalanced from time to time can help in avoiding excessive risk and maintain optimal returns. Tax efficiency You can also opt for tax-saving mutual funds, known as equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS). With ELSS funds, you can claim a tax rebate of Rs 1,50,000 under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. By investing in ELSS funds, you can get the dual benefit of wealth accumulation along with tax deductions. Conclusion Retirement mutual funds can potentially offer capital appreciation and stable returns along with the flexibility required. It is ideal to seek professional guidance from a fund manager who can cater to your specific retirement goals.

Arnab’s car attacked in Mumbai; two held,"Republic TV Editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami was allegedly attacked by two bike-borne persons late on Wednesday. The Editor was returning home along with his wife when the attack took place. The attackers were caught by his security personnel and were handed over to the police. Both Arnab and his wife Samia Goswami were unhurt in the attack. Goswami in his complaint to police said, “Around 12.15 am when we reached Ganpatrao Kadam Marg, two men followed our car and tried to overtake.” These two attackers initially tried to identify the driver following which they stretched their arm pointing at him and then blocked his path. “The pillion rider hit the right side driver window several times and then, these attackers realised that the car window was up and they couldn’t break through and immediately, the pillion rider removed the liquid bottle from his pocket and threw liquid all over the car on the driver’s side where I was sitting,” said Goswami in his statement to police. He further added that while the two were shouting and abusing him in Hindi while making violent gestures, he had ducked his head towards the steering wheel and managed to get sight of the road ahead and pressed on the accelerator swerving to his left. After he managed to get back on the road, Goswami said that when he saw on his read view mirror, the protection provided by the Mumbai police and his personal security guard had got hold of the two.The patrolling police from the NM Joshi Marg police station noticed that few people had gathered at a spot at Ganpatrao Kadam Marg. “When we went close to them and inquired, we learnt that the two had attacked Goswami,” said an official. They then called for a backup following which the two were taken to NM Joshi Marg police station. The police then recorded the statement of Goswami following which a case was registered under sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. The two accused identified as Arun Borade and Prateek Mishra were arrested. An investigator said, “We have learnt that they are affiliated with the youth Congress wing in Sion which we are trying to confirm. We are trying to get more information on them.” On Thursday, an FIR was lodged against Goswami in Abohar, Punjab, under Sections 153-A, 153-B, 295-A, 594, 596 of the IPC and Section 67 of the IT Act after a complaint by Harmohinder Singh Grover, Chairman of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee Freedom Fighter Cell. The FIR was registered against Goswami for allegedly making derogatory remarks against Congress president Sonia Gandhi during his TV show. Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary also lodged a complaint with the police for registration of an FIR against Goswami. The Chhattisgarh unit of the Congress lodged a formal complaint against Goswami on Wednesday, and accused him of “deliberately making inflammatory statements” and using derogatory language against Sonia Gandhi in his show. In Maharashtra, State Youth Congress (YC) president Satyajeet Tambe said he had filed a complaint against Goswami in Sangamner and instructed YC workers to file complaints in all districts. In Nagpur, State Power Minister Nitin Raut’s son Kunal, a YC office-bearer, filed a similar complaint. Reacting to the attack on Arnab, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said, “We condemn the attempt to attack Arnab Goswami. We condemn every attack on any journalist. This is against democracy and it is really ironical that those who preach tolerance have become so intolerant. Therefore we condemn this attempt. “We appeal to the collective wisdom that this is undemocratic and as per present law Police definitely takes action if there is a complaint,” ANI quoted Javadekar as saying.

Desi touch,"At least two Supreme Court judges, one of them the Chief Justice, have in recent months suggested “Indianisation” of the legal system. Chief Justice NV Ramana’s thought was limited to adapting the system to Indian “realities” and localising the justice delivery systems. Justice S Abdul Nazeer, however, wanted to “decolonise” the Indian legal system, emphasising that the ancient traditions of Manu, Kautilya or Yagnavalkya could not be neglected. He echoed former Chief Justice PN Bhagwati who once said our judicial thinking could not be “constricted” by reference to the law as it prevails in England. It is not the first such call. The Constituent Assembly debates touched upon this issue. In these times when nationalism is becoming almost a social grace, de-westernising Indian jurisprudence could as well be equated with a nationalist legal system. The history of India’s legal system is sufficiently ancient, dating back to the Vedic period or even earlier. The Mahabharata has references to the institution of Dharma. In the Vedic times, the objective of the law was to preserve Dharma that consisted of both legal and religious duties. Manu Smriti prescribes the rules and regulations for defending Dharma. The courts recognised three systems of law — Dharma Shastra, Arth Shastra and Sadachara or Charitra. The principles of jurisprudence were well-defined with grounds of litigation, jury systems, laws relating to witnesses, classification of “vivada” (disputes) and even judicial psychology. The legal tradition changed to one based around religious communities when the Mughals came in. While the Emperor’s law was all-powerful and the Sunni Hanafi tradition was the official legal system, the Shia and Hindu legal traditions were also recognised and practised. In the British period, the law evolved from religious prescription to the common law system. The British started coding the law and drafted the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure and other statutes. When India became Independent, the Constitution steered Indian law away from colonial law to an organic one that has elements of secular law (once practised under the Mauryas) but predominantly rooting for social welfare to empower the weakest members of society. We need more clarity on what is meant by “Indianising” the legal system. It surely cannot be going back to the Vedic times. What exactly would we borrow from that period — the codification of law or the social ethos of that time that dictated the codification? For example, Indian law as we know it, does not, unlike the ancient law, distinguish between castes and communities. The current system stands for social justice and equality before law, not Brahminical interpretation of social code, rigid caste structures and patriarchy. Or, take the case of the Supreme Court judgment lifting the ban on entry of women of menstruating age into the Sabarimala temple. Would the ancient law have challenged a code backed by religion? A legal system can be tweaked but without diminishing its ability to serve justice in the times we live in.","Recently, Chief Justice NV Ramana and Justice S Abdul Nazeer of the Indian Supreme Court have advocated for the ""Indianisation"" of the legal system. Chief Justice Ramana emphasized adapting the system to Indian realities and localizing justice delivery, while Justice Nazeer called for decolonizing the legal system, suggesting that India's ancient legal traditions from figures like Manu and Kautilya should not be neglected. This echoes sentiments from former Chief Justice PN Bhagwati, who argued against constricting Indian judicial thinking to English law. India's legal history is ancient, with references to Dharma in the Mahabharata and laws from Vedic times focused on preserving Dharma through legal and religious duties. During the Mughal period, law varied by religious community, while British rule introduced a common law system and codified laws like the Indian Penal Code. Post-independence, the Indian Constitution shifted towards an organic legal system prioritizing social welfare and equality. The call for Indianising the legal system raises questions about its meaning. It cannot imply a return to Vedic-era laws, which distinguished between castes and communities, unlike contemporary Indian law which upholds social justice and equality. The Supreme Court's decision on the Sabarimala temple case, which lifted the ban on menstruating women, highlights the challenges of integrating ancient legal principles with modern justice. Any changes to the legal system must enhance its ability to serve contemporary justice without regressing to outdated social norms.",law,2021-12-31 00:00:00
Government aims to transform fair price shops into nutri-hubs,"The Indian government is set to transform around 100,000 fair price shops into ""nutri-hubs"" under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) over the next three years. These shops will sell nutritious items like millets, pulses, and dairy, along with subsidized grains. The initiative aims to generate additional income for shop owners and improve public nutrition. The government is collaborating with Sidbi and B2B platforms like Udaan to support these shops financially and operationally. This plan includes providing loans and credit facilities to shop owners, who will also sell FMCG products to boost their income. Additionally, these ""nutri-hubs"" aim to enhance the distribution and accessibility of nutritious products to a larger population. The Food Ministry has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development to develop the entrepreneurship skills of ration dealers. A pilot program has been launched in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh, with selected fair price shops being converted into ""Jan Poshan Kendras"" (nutrition hubs). The initiative also includes operational reforms, such as integrating digital payment systems and other measures to streamline operations and improve efficiency at these outlets.

Chandrayaan-1: The first time India ‘touched’ the Moon,"Chandrayaan-1 carried a module called the Moon Impact Probe, which was dropped to the lunar surface as proof of India’s arrival. Madhavan, what evidence are you going to show before the world that we reached the Moon?” APJ Abdul Kalam asked G Madhavan Nair, the chairman of Isro (2003-2009), prior to the launch of Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. “When we carried out missions to Everest and Antarctica, we placed our flag there. In the case of the Moon mission, we are relying to convince the world with a lot of digital data. Don’t you think we should do something more?” Dr Kalam asked. At the time he raised this question, Dr Kalam was the President of India and the country’s most respected scientific mind. Nair writes in his autobiographical work Rocketing Through the Skies: An Eventful Life at ISRO (2023), that this one simple question modified his entire perspective – giving birth to the concept of the Moon Impact Probe (MIP), carried aboard Chandrayaan-1. As Chandrayaan-3 lands on the Moon today, we recall when India first “planted a flag” on the Moon. India’s first foray to the Moon Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (1924-2018) announced India’s moon mission in his Independence Day speech in 2003. This would be India’s first foray outside Earth’s gravitational pull and the most challenging task undertaken by the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) until then.","Chandrayaan-1 was India's first lunar probe, a special kind of spacecraft sent to study the Moon. Launched in 2008, it carried a suite of scientific instruments designed to explore and gather information about Earth's celestial neighbor. The spacecraft made significant contributions to lunar science, including the discovery of water molecules on the Moon's surface. Chandrayaan-1 was equipped with various instruments, such as a Moon Impact Probe (MIP) and a Moon Impact Probe (MIP), which played a vital role in expanding our understanding of the Moon's composition and surface features. The mission's most notable discovery was made by the Moon Impact Probe, which found evidence of water molecules on the lunar surface. Despite its planned two-year mission being cut short in 2009 due to communication issues, Chandrayaan-1 made a lasting impact on lunar exploration. It laid the groundwork for subsequent lunar missions and strengthened India's position in space exploration. The mission demonstrated India's growing capabilities in space technology and contributed valuable data to the global scientific community's understanding of the Moon.",Technology and Gadgets,2023-08-24 00:00:00

"Rs25,000-crore irrigation plan underway in State","The State Government is formulating an ambitious irrigation plan of Rs25,000 crore to create irrigation facility for more 10 lakh hectares of land in next three years. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has already asked Water Resources Department officials to chalk out the plan and implement the same at the earliest. Water Resources Secretary Pradeep Kumar Jena on Tuesday held discussion with the Engineer-In-Chief and Chief Engineers in this regard. According to information, 10 major irrigation projects, which are scheduled to be completed by 2019 at a total expenditure of Rs9,000 crore, have been allocated Rs1,000 crore for the current fiscal. These major projects were facing funds crunch as the Centre has already stopped providing funds under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) for the last three years and thereby the State has lost Rs5,200 crore. Jena said that the State Government has taken up 174 lift irrigation projects in 15 clusters in western, southern and some coastal areas. These projects, estimated to come up at Rs5,500 crore, would irrigate 2.5 lakh hectares in next three years. The State Government is targeting to cover all the 110 blocks having less than 35 per cent irrigation coverage during the period. Meanwhile, difficult areas have been identified. It has been targeted to construct 12,000 check dams at a total cost of Rs3,000 crore. While 2,000 would be constructed this year, 4,000 have been targeted for the next year. Similarly, existing canals would be developed at Rs2,000 crore so that water would reach their respective tail ends without disruption. Besides, digging up of bores wells would be emphasised. As of now 37,000 out of 57,000 bore wells have been energised. Farmers would be provided loans from the Odisha State Cooperative Bank (OSCB) for establishing bore wells, said sources.","The State Government of Odisha is planning an irrigation project with an investment of INR 25,000 crore to provide irrigation facilities for over 1 million hectares of land within the next three years.

2G probe: SC asks why Raja is still a minister R Sedhuraman Legal Correspondent,"The Supreme Court today slammed the UPA government for letting Telecom Minister A Raja continue in office despite the serious allegation of a Rs 70,000 crore scam in the allocation of 2G Spectrum in 2008. “The same minister is continuing. Is it the way the government is functioning? Is it rule of law? You follow the same standard in respect of every one,” a Bench comprising Justices GS Singhvi and AK Ganguly remarked. The advice for adopting the “same standard” is viewed as a swipe at the government for adopting a different yardstick for Minister of State for External Affairs Shashi Tharoor while asking him to quit earlier this year for alleged misuse of office. Tharoor had reportedly helped his friend, Sunanda Pushkar, get a stake free of cost (sweat equity) in the Kochi franchise of cricket’s Indian Premier League (IPL). Incidentally, Tharoor married Sunanda shortly after his unceremonious exit. The Bench made the remarks while hearing arguments on a PIL filed by an NGO, Centre for PIL, which has pleaded that the SC monitor the investigations into the scam. Arguing for the CPIL, Counsel Prashant Bhushan said the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) were unduly taking a long time to probe the issue. Raja had not even been interrogated by the CBI despite the fact that many of the irregularities pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) were incontrovertible, he said. At this, Raja’s counsel AR Andyarujina said the petitioner was sensationalising the case. The minister had gone ahead with the 2G allocation at 2001 prices instead of taking the auction route only after Cabinet’s approval, he contended. Further, the CAG had submitted only its “draft” audit report and not the final report. When Additional Solicitor-General (ASG) Haren Raval, who appeared for the CBI and the ED, contended that the investigations were proceeding in the “right direction,” the Bench pointed out that already “one year has gone by.” As the ASG sought some more time to complete the probe, the Bench retorted, “How long will you take. Another 10 years?” The ASG said “within six months.” Describing the probe “very slip-shod,” the Bench told the CBI: “You are dragging your feet.” The ASG, however, maintained that the CBI was doing a difficult work. “The records will show the enormity of the material and the complex issues involved. We have examined more than 5,800 telephone calls” relating to the scam. The Bench asked the ASG why the Spectrum was allocated at 2001 prices. Raval said he did not know why because he was not appearing for the DoT. Solicitor General Gopal Subramanium, who represents the Centre and the DoT in the case, was not present in the court as he had reported sick.","The Supreme Court criticized the UPA government for allowing Telecom Minister A Raja to continue in office despite allegations of a Rs 70,000 crore ($9 billion) scam in the allocation of 2G Spectrum in 2008.

Suspected IM explosives supplier arrested from Haryana,"An explosives supplier in the Mangalore region suspected to be involved in the illegal sale of ammonium nitrate to stone quarries for years and considered the possible explosives source for some Indian Mujahideen blasts in the country has been arrested for allegedly selling explosives illegally. A licensed explosives supplier, Biju Thomas was picked up in Haryana two days ago and produced in an Udupi court Wednesday. Thomas was on the run for nearly three weeks after the Karkala police raided his stockyard and seized more than 14,000 kg of ammonium nitrate in connection with a case of illegal sales. The raids were conducted shortly after IM operatives Zia-ur-Rehman alias Waqas and Tehseen Akhtar alias Monu, who were arrested by the Delhi Police Special Cell in late March, were brought to Mangalore on April 8 to identify their hideout at the Zephyr Heights apartment and their explosives supply source. Advertisement Sources familiar with the investigations said Thomas had not been booked in a terror case since it was yet to be established if he was aware of the sale to IM operatives. Four cases of illegal sale had been registered against Thomas, sources said. “This seems to have been the primary source of explosives supply to the Indian Mujahideen. The identities of the actual intermediaries who exploited the illegal sale of explosives to source ammonium nitrate for terrorist operations is yet to be ascertained,” sources said. “The place where IM operatives stored explosives is also yet to be identified.” Thomas came under the scanner in 2010 as a possible IM explosives source following the Chinnaswamy Stadium blasts.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a few rallies here over the weekend. In the 2009 Assembly polls, Congress dominated the show by winning 18 out of the 46 seats.

The curious case of Urdu in NEP 2020,"Despite clarifications by the government the controversy is not dying. It calls for analysis of the NEP 2020 from the perspective of the status of Urdu. Representational Image The Union Cabinet approved the new National Education Policy 2020 (hereafter NEP 2020) on 29 July, which proposes drastic changes in the Indian education system. While there are several changes, reforms and policies that are being widely appreciated there are many ambiguities, gaps and contradictions that are creating apprehensions in the minds of many in general and linguistic and religious minorities in particular. NEP 2020 has given birth to apprehensions in the minds of Urdu lovers due to its unique status. It should be borne in mind that Urdu is a pan-Indian language but it lacks the patronage of any state as official language. Strangely, Urdu has not been mentioned anywhere in the 66 pages NEP 2020 released by the Union government. This conspicuous absence of Urdu drew widespread criticism across the country. The government tried to alley the apprehensions of Urdu-lovers and Secretary of Higher Education is reported to have said: “Para 4.12, 22.6 and 22.18 of NEP 2020 talk of all languages mentioned in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, which includes Urdu. Incidentally, what is being deliberately and mischievously suppressed is that these paras do not talk of Hindi also, rather all languages of the Eighth Schedule are mentioned”. Despite clarifications by the government the controversy is not dying. It calls for analysis of the NEP 2020 from the perspective of the status of Urdu. NEP 2020 declares that “wherever possible, the medium of instructions until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be home language/mother tongue/local language/regional language”. (para 4.11, p.13) This emphasis on the mother tongue arouses hopes that many languages of India facing the challenge of survival due to deliberate design of the colonial masters and later on the apathy of the successive governments may be saved from extinction. Under the sub-heading, Multilingualism and the Power of Language, the government recognises the fact that “young children learn and grasp nontrivial concepts more quickly in their home language/mother tongue”. While emphasis on primary education in mother tongue is praiseworthy the determination of home/local language will be problematic because the NEP 2020 does not mention what will be the unit of determination of local or home language. For example, what is the home language of the people living in cities like Lucknow, Delhi, Moradabad, Meerut or states like UP, Bihar, Telangana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and so on is indeed very difficult to determine. Under these circumstances, the role of the central and state governments will become crucial in implementation of the three-language formula and Urdu in the absence of patronage and lacking job opportunities will certainly be marginalised. Another important dimension of the language policy under NEP 2020 is the promise that “there will be a greater flexibility in the three-language formula, and no language will be imposed on any state. The three languages learned by children will be the choices of states, regions, and of course the students themselves, so long as at least two of the three languages are native to India.”(para 4.13, p. 14) However, determination of a ‘region’ for the purpose of the implementation of the three-language formula needs clarification. Besides, three entities — states, regions and students — are created for exercising the freedom of choice in selection of three languages to be taught. The question is what will happen if there is a clash in choice between states and students. For instance, a group of Urdu speaking students want to study Urdu while state emphasizes on Hindi, Sanskrit, Bangla, Odia, etc. The apprehensions of Urdu-lovers are not unfounded because NEP 2020 besides especially promoting Sanskrit makes reference to other classical languages like Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Pali, Persian and Prakrit but Urdu is not mentioned as a classical language as it seems that only ancient and not the medieval language/languages are recognized as classical under NEP 2020. While the allegation of deliberate exclusion of Urdu is doing the rounds the government decided to introduce the Jammu and Kashmir Official Languages Bill 2020 in Parliament under which Urdu is set to lose its status of the sole official language of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The anxiety can also be understood from the fact that according to Census of India 2011 Urdu is showing a steady decline as mother tongue since 1981(5.25), 1991(5.18), 2001 (5.01), and 2011(4.19). Unlike other languages of the Schedule 8 of Indian Constitution whose speakers enjoy strong regional or state backing, people who speak Urdu are spread all over the country and therefore, it needs special consideration by the government for its survival and promotion. The writer is a professor of political science at Aligarh Muslim University","The National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020), approved by the Union Cabinet, has sparked controversy regarding its treatment of Urdu, a language with unique pan-Indian significance but without official state patronage. Despite attempts by the government to clarify that Urdu is covered under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution, its absence in the NEP document has drawn widespread criticism. The policy emphasizes primary education in mother tongue or local language until Grade 5, aiming to preserve endangered languages. However, concerns persist over the definition of ""local"" or ""home"" language in diverse urban and regional contexts like Lucknow, Delhi, and various states. The NEP's flexibility in the three-language formula allows states and students to choose languages, potentially marginalizing Urdu if states prioritize other languages like Hindi or Sanskrit. Moreover, the policy's reference to classical languages excludes Urdu, raising further apprehensions about its linguistic and cultural recognition. Amidst declining census figures for Urdu speakers, advocates stress the need for specific governmental support to ensure its survival and promotion across India.",Education,2020-09-18 00:00:00

Flipkart scouts for land to develop campus to house all its businesses,"BENGALURU: Walmart-owned Flipkart is looking for a new address. India’s largest online retail platform is scouting for land to develop a campus that will house all its businesses, according to realtors and industry officials. The project is expected to cost Rs 1,500 crore. One of Bengaluru’s oldest realtors said he was given a brief by Flipkart through an international realtor to find land for the ecommerce company. “Flipkart is looking for 150 acres of land, located 50-60 km from Bengaluru, to build a campus as the company wants to consolidate all its business operations,” the realtor said, asking not to be identified. “The company wants to complete the entire development in four years and is asking for recommendations for a builder who can deliver quickly.” Flipkart has already rejected two land reports submitted by the realtor but talks are still on, he said. The company is also said to be looking for land for its proposed campus in Chennai and Hyderabad. Flipkart declined to comment on the matter. The planned Flipkart campus project is expected to cost Rs 1,500 crore, according to industry officials. Going by the current real estate market in Bengaluru, the land should come at Rs 400-450 crore, said a real estate developer. The rest of the project cost will depend on the builder. According to the brief, Flipkart wants to allocate a minimum of 25 acres of the 150-acre campus for warehousing. “It will be a transit warehouse which will stock only products with short shelf life. The campus will also include an experience centre,” the realtor said. About 30 other realtors have been approached to look for the land, he said. Currently, Flipkart operates out of Bengaluru with an office located on outer ring road. Its fashion-retail subsidiary Myntra has a separate office in the city. Since Walmart is a majority stakeholder in Flipkart, the ecommerce giant may not be able to directly purchase land in India because foreign nationals are not allowed to acquire immovable property in the country. “As of now, Flipkart is clear that it wants to purchase land. It will be an FDI investment. They have specifically asked for ‘gold-mine’ land that should appreciate in value,” said the realtor.","Flipkart, India's largest online retail platform, is seeking land to develop a campus to consolidate its business operations.

Government kicks off New Year with fresh electoral bond sales from January 2,"This is the 30th tranche of bond issuances under the electoral bond scheme that was launched in 2018 to “cleanse the system of political funding”, and is being scrutinised by the Supreme Court.

Dance transcends boundaries,"T Reddi Lakshmi is a young Kuchipudi dancer, from New Delhi. Early in her career, she has reached a take-off stage to carry on a performance, which any Kuchipudi Guru and audience would be proud of. She was in Hyderabad recently for the Nartanam Conclave 2017. How did you take up dance? I took dance training at Sri Saraswati Shishu Mandir till the age of six years. Later, when I went to Delhi, I took training from Seeta Nagajyoti. She then introduced me to Guru Jayarama Rao. How was the teaching time with Guruji? Guru Jayarama Rao had a very different style of teaching. He would hardly speak and always gave me the liberty to express my emotions. All his students have been encouraged to develop their own body language and emotion. For the same storyline, the intensity of performance would change from student to student as per their ability. This is a very important aspect of creativity so that we do not try to only ‘copycat’ any emotion. It has to develop and come out of each and every individual and that would always vary from person to person. How is the present generation responding to Kuchipudi dance form? The younger generation is very impatient. Even the parents want their children to learn the dance form and quickly start performing on stage. Kuchipudi has a lot of depth and nuances in a performance and they do not come easy. One needs to put in many hours and years into work before they can establish themselves. How is the situation in north India for Kuchipudi? There are students from the north, who also learn Kuchipudi from Guruji. Language is not a barrier as they understand the material in detail and then start working on it. For example, being a south Indian, I have translated many Hindi bhajans, understood them and give a dance performance around them. Do you see any improvement in the corporate sponsorship or Government sponsorship towards classical arts? Government sponsorship is very much there. But I feel that the planning needs to improve so that once any support is granted for long tours in India or abroad, an artiste should get an opportunity to reach out to maximum cultural centres and people out there. As far as the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) of the private sector is concerned, it’s very clear that if you do not know anyone in a private company, the chances of getting sponsorship are nearly zero. There could be the humiliation of your project and concept being questioned if it could make an impact on the sale of the company products. Most of the private sector is purely interested in pushing the sales of its product when it sponsors any classical art.","T Reddi Lakshmi, a young Kuchipudi dancer based in New Delhi, shares insights into her journey in dance and the challenges faced by the present generation in embracing classical art forms. Trained under Guru Jayarama Rao, she emphasizes the importance of individual expression in dance. Lakshmi discusses the growing interest in Kuchipudi in north India, highlighting the dedication required for mastery. Regarding sponsorship, she notes government support but calls for better planning, while expressing skepticism about corporate sponsorship, citing commercial interests.",Arts and Culture,2017-10-22 00:00:00
‘Roti Bank’ comes up in Aurangabad for the poor,"Aurangabad (Maharashtra): A unique ‘roti bank’ has been launched in this city, famous for its Ajanta-Ellora caves, for the poor. People can ‘deposit’ rotis and the poor, aged, sick or the unemployed people can ‘withdraw’ a basic fare of freshly-cooked rotis and a vegetarian or non-vegetarian dish. The Roti Bank — first of its kind in Maharashtra, and second in India after a similar venture in Bundelkhand, Uttar Pradesh – was launched on December 5 by Yusuf Mukati, the founder of Haroon Mukati Islamic Centre (HMIC), on the busy Jinsi-Baijipura Road in the heart of the city. “Over the years, I saw many poor people, especially Muslims, who can’t afford one square meal a day… The situation is pathetic in large families with just one bread-winner. But because they live a dignified life, they do not resort to begging,” Mukati told IANS. Targetting many such poor and deprived families, the idea of a ‘Roti Bank’ crystallized — and the 38-year-old Mukati made it clear that beggars would not be entertained here. After discussing with his wife Kauser, and his four married sisters – Seema Shalimar, Mumtaz Memon, Shehnaz Sabani, Huma Pariyani — the ‘Roti Bank’ finally went ‘public’ with a modest 250 ‘depositors’ on December 5. Initially, curious passers-by would stop to ask about it but feel delighted to see it was a noble initiative. People have to fill up a form for Roti Bank’s membership. “We allot them a specific code number. The request is simple — Simply deliver us minimum freshly cooked two rotis and a plate of vegetarian or non-vegetarian food that they prepare for family at home daily,” Mukati said. The idea clicked and within a fortnight the membership shot up by nearly 25 percent, and Mukati — who runs a garment shop along with his realty consultancy — is optimistic it will double soon. “The bank timings are 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. People can voluntarily ‘deposit’ their food, once a day or even more… Similarly, the poor people can come any time to collect the food as per their convenience and availability,” Mukati said. The unique bank provides special carry bags with a code number to each ‘depositor’ on receipt. It is checked for freshness and quality, and then disbursed to the lucky families daily. “The membership is growing, and occasionally food deposits are also higher than expectations — So, on an average, we feed around 500 poor people daily,” Mukati told IANS. He emphasized that over one-third of the donors and beneficiaries are non-Muslims and want to increase their contribution gradually “since food is the right of all human beings, irrespective of religion or financial status”. As word spread about the noble venture wedding oganisers started dispatching the extra food left over due to guest absenteeism. “Since launch, at least six Hindu wedding organizers sent us 50-60 plates of excellent vegetarian food and another dozen Muslim marriage organizers also sent a similar quantity of non-vegetarian fare,” he said. “We store it separately in huge freezers with a capacity for 700 packets. The beneficiaries can take the food of their choice (veg/non-veg),” said Mukati while appealing to big restaurants, deluxe hotels, corporate and industrial canteens, flight kitchens and mega-event organisers to contribute their unconsumed, extra food for the Roti Bank. He feels it will ensure there is “absolutely no wastage” of food anywhere any time in the city of 1.17 million population of which around 31 percent are Muslims. Dwelling on the deplorable plight of Muslim women in the city, Kauser, his wife, said the divorce rates are very high, especially among young women. She said the problem is acute…thousands of very young illiterate or semi-literate girls are pushed into marriage with much older men, and then divorced very soon… Their families borrow large amounts for marriages… “These unfortunate girls, at times with tiny children, have no social security, nobody to house, feed or employ them,” said Kauser, who helps her husband in the Roti Bank venture. In its own way, the Haroon Mukati Islamic Centre is contributing to women’s uplift with an academic centre for 2,000 girls in which they impart regular spiritual and vocational education in 15 different vocations, including yoga, fashion designing and computers. “This equips the young girls with a capacity to earn a living and in case of any future problems, at least they will not starve or be driven to the road,” Kauser pointed out. Incidentally, around 100 girl students from middle or upper-middle-class families have become Roti Bank members and contribute daily. It is disbursed among their less fortunate classmates. (IANS)","A unique ‘Roti Bank’ has been launched in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, providing freshly cooked rotis and meals to the poor, aged, and unemployed.

Over 250 families initially joined, rising quickly due to community support. The initiative feeds around 500 people daily and accepts surplus food from weddings and events to reduce wastage. Mukati’s wife, Kauser, highlighted the plight of divorced Muslim women and shared how the centre also empowers girls through spiritual and vocational education, ensuring they can earn a living and remain self-reliant.",National News,2015-12-29 00:00:00
Check abnormal surge in airfares: Jyotiraditya Scindia to airlines,"NEW DELHI: Airfares have surged sharply over the weekend, especially on routes that were earlier serviced by Go First. In some cases, the fare is now 10 times higher than what it what just days ago. On Monday, the cost of an economy class ticket on a non-stop Delhi-Mumbai flight for Tuesday ranged between Rs 16,000 and Rs 30,000. On the Delhi-Chennai route, the prices ranged between Rs 17,000 and Rs 32,000. To address the situation, Union aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia held a meeting with the Airlines Advisory Group and urged all airlines them to self-regulate their ticket prices. “The airlines must self-monitor airfares on certain select routes that have seen considerable surge pricing of late, particularly those that were earlier being serviced by Go First. A mechanism for ensuring reasonable pricing within the high RBDs (Reservation Booking Designator) may be devised by airlines. This shall be monitored by the DGCA,” Scindia said after the meeting with the Airlines Advisory Group. Go First stopped flying on May 3, which led to a reduction of capacity at a time when the peak domestic air travel period is around the corner. IndiGo and the Air India group have been accused of using the demand-supply mismatch to raise ticket fares. Mark Martin, founder and CEO of Martin Consulting, said that it is very important for the government to set checks and balances to protect consumers’ interests, especially from price cartelisation by airlines. “A fresh body should be enacted to monitor ticket prices on an ongoing basis. India is one of the world’s largest aviation markets and therefore it is mandatory that common travellers should not suffer on account of duopolies (referring to IndiGo and Tata Group airlines),” Martin told TNIE. Meanwhile, Scindia urged airlines to provide free cargo services to the families of those who died in the Odisha rail accident.","Airfares have surged sharply over the weekend, especially on routes previously serviced by Go First, following the airline's cessation of operations.

Desire for peace holds sway,"WHEN Pakistan’s army ruler, Gen Parvez Musharraf was touring Malaysia and Singapore to test his “look-east policy”, 39 Indian women — students, artists, filmmakers, lawyers and social activists — sat with their Pakistani counterparts in Lahore. They were seeking alternative ways and means for civil society to intervene and bring peace. Mr Nirmala Deshpande, leader of the Women’s Initiative for peace in South Asia (Wipsa), who led the busload of these well-meaning women was aware of the failure of the bus diplomacy between the two Prime Ministers, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee and Mr Nawaz Sharif. She thought of the abject failure of the political leadership in the two countries to sort out the jumbled issues and come to terms with reality and establish peace. This peace is essential if the two countries are to remove poverty and ignorance in the Indian subcontinent. It was a mission for “goli nahi boli” that established fast rapport. Once again the desire for peace seemed to sway the day at the seminar in Lahore on March 29. Bonhomie was clear and established. Mrs Deshpande wanted the Pakistani counterparts, human right activist Asma Jahangir and Friday Times Executive Editor Jugnu Moshin (Remember the lady who fought valiantly to seek the release of husband, Mr Najm Sethi, Editor of Friday Times who was arrested by the ousted Prime Minister) to come to India in double the number. It was immediately responded and within 30 days, two busloads of Pakistani women will be in Delhi. They will be again trying to intervene and save the two countries from plunging into a war. The mood in Pakistan, if the mainline newspapers are any guide, is chastened after the visit of the American President, Mr Bill Clinton, and his frank words. While a section of the Pakistani intelligentsia is keen to turn towards other Muslim countries and China for support, there is also a great desire for peace with India. This very sentiment prevailed at the seminar. As journalists observed, relations between the two nuclear neighbours are bad, yet this kind of effort was not considered a waste. “Given the current attitude of the two governments, this kind of public pressure was considered the only way out to bring the governments and the people together,” was one such observation. Amidst tight security at a Lahore hotel where these women met for a full day, some of the speakers did not mince words to put across their frank but candid opinions. It is worth reproducing what the well known human right activist and fighter for public causes, Ms Jahangir said”. “Hostility between India and Pakistan and the nuclearisation of these two adversaries has made the region unsafe, diverted national resources, and distorted national priorities and the national self-image. Rather than seeing the poverty and dirt surrounding us, many of us are deluded by a hollow image of national greatness. “A chaotic Pakistan will hamper progress in India. A ruthless, strong India will divide South Asia and hurt the interests of the entire region. More than ever before, the people of the South Asian region have common interests.... Our efforts have to be focused on issues that can be resolved through the intervention of civil society... on the Pak-India front we need to pursue renewed dialogue and an end to the Siachen problem. The policies of the two countries must shift from concerns of security to the development and respect of people,” Ms Jehangir argued. Ms Shobhana Bhattacharya, one of the Indian participants, referred to the problem of fundamentalism that posed common danger to both countries. Calling for a “rational response” to the problem, she said reactions determined by fear would not yield dividends. Ms Bhattacharya argued that people should use “knowledge” as a weapon to counter fundamentalism. Ms Meera Aggarwal, Deputy Mayor of Delhi, stressed the need for women to come forward in the policy making arena and referred to the common problems faced by both India and Pakistan. According to Ms Jugnu Moshin, there was a need for the concerned citizen in India to challenge the “consensus on foreign policy”. She said” This conference will prove useful in bringing gaps, cementing common thoughts, and giving the urge for peace new impetus. But that is not enough. We must change minds in our respective countries, where prejudice parades as consensus. Until both Indians and Pakistanis begin to think differently, peace will remain elusive,” And back to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore where General Musharraf was clearly told that democracy had to be restored if he wished to have a meaningful economic partnership on a long term basis. The present atmosphere of uncertainty would not help the Pakistani people to come out of economic morass General Musharraf sought trade and economic help and said Pakistan had a geostrategic location and was a gateway for central, southern and western segments of Asia. He wanted Pakistan to become a full-time dialogue member of the Asean. He was looking towards east for a long lasting economic relationship. It is good that the new Pakistani ruler is aware of the acute economic situation. But this visit would make him aware of the need to have a democratic Pakistan to have any lasting and meaningful relationship. Malaysian Foreign Minister Hamid Alber made things very clear for the Pakistani leader. There was no joint communiqué as the visit sought by Gen Musharraf was purely a working visit. Evidently, the General has to travel a long way to impress his legitimacy. Meanwhile, it would be more useful to listen to these women whose yearning for peace was totally sincere.","he article discusses a peace initiative led by women from India and Pakistan who gathered in Lahore to seek alternative ways for civil society to intervene and bring about peace between the two countries. The Women’s Initiative for Peace in South Asia (WIPSA), led by Nirmala Deshpande, held a seminar in Lahore where Indian and Pakistani women discussed the need for dialogue and peace, emphasizing the failure of political leadership in resolving conflicts. The article highlights the desire for peace among the participants and their efforts to bridge gaps between the two nations. It also briefly mentions General Musharraf's visit to Malaysia and Singapore, where he faced calls for the restoration of democracy for meaningful economic partnerships.",Opinion and Editorial,2000-03-31 00:00:00

It's like thief attacking cop: BJP on poaching allegations,"Rejecting the Congress? charge of poaching its MLAs in Gujarat, the BJP has said it had no role in the recent desertion by six of its legislators and wondered whether they were ?purchasable?.It also said that the sole of aim of the Congress was to save its vice president Rahul Gandhi in the country and Ahmed Patel in Gujarat.Taking a dig at the Congress after it ferried its MLAs to Bengaluru to keep its flock together ahead of the August 8 Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said the lawmakers were ?enjoying themselves? there while those of the BJP were busy providing relief to the flood-hit people in the state.The party shepherded 44 lawmakers on Friday night to the holiday retreat in Karnakata after a spate of resignation of its MLAs amid allegations that the ruling BJP in Gujarat were bribing and coercing them ahead of the August 8 vice-presidential election.?Gujarat Congress leaders are leveling allegations at the BJP in Bengaluru. It is like a thief attacking a cop. If their leaders are leaving them, it has nothing to do with us,? Javadekar told PTI on Sunday after the Congress attacked the saffron party.He noted that senior Congress leaders like Shankersinh Vaghela, a former chief minister and the leader of opposition, its chief whip Balwantsinh Rajput and its spokesperson Tejashreeben Patel have left the party and wondered if the opposition party was suggesting that they could be ?bought?.?They are all strong leaders. Nobody can purchase them. The Congress should look inwards and think why such senior leaders are leaving it. The truth is that its only goal is to save Rahul Gandhi in the country and Ahmed Patel in Gujarat,? he said.Patel is seeking re-election to the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat but defection by a number of Congress MLAs has left the party worried. The BJP has fielded Rajput, who quit the Congress on Thursday, against Patel to further queer his pitch.The Congress was growing weak across the country and it was not BJP?s fault, Javadekar said.In Ahmedabad, chief minister Vijay Rupani alleged that the decision to fly the Congress MLAs to Bengaluru amid flood-like situation in the state was taken by Patel out of his ?greed? to win the election.?Sonia Gandhi?s affection for her son has drowned the Congress in the entire country. Though the citizens rejected Rahul Gandhi?s leadership, Sonia?s ?putramoh? sank Congress. Similarly, Ahmed Patel?s greed to save his Rajya Sabha seat here will sink Gujarat Congress,? he said.According to Rupani, the Congress MLAs from flood-hot Banaskantha and other affected regions should have stayed with the people in this difficult time.?Out of his greed to win the Rajya Sabha poll, he (Patel) sent 40 Congress MLAs to Bengaluru. Some of them belonged to those districts which are badly hit by flood. Patel forced them to leave their constituencies, as he was only concerned about his Rajya Sabha seat,? the chief minister alleged.?The people of Gujarat are watching this. I believe that the Gujarat Congress will sink only because of Ahmed Patel,? he added.Patel, however, refuted Rupani?s allegation and said the Congress MLAs were forced to leave the state by the BJP-led state government.In the 182-member Gujarat Assembly, the strength of the Congress has gone down to 51 from 57 after six of its MLAs tendered their resignations.Party spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said the Congress legislators are willing to return home if Rupani promises their safety.?We have been threatened, offered money to defect and some have done so,?

Heritage tag for 12 Maratha forts: 44th Indian entry to get Unesco recognition,"The Chilkhati bastion of Pratapgad with the hill ranges and forests in the background; (right) a view of the Suvela Maachi in Rajgad with double fortification walls. Pictures courtesy: Dronah/ Unesco The Maratha Military Landscapes, a network of 12 forts representing the fortification and military system put in place by the Maratha rulers, have been added to the Unesco World Heritage List. This is India’s 44th entry on the coveted list. The forts, built between the 17th and 19th centuries, are Salher, Shivneri, Lohgad, Khanderi, Raigad, Rajgad, Pratapgad, Suvarnadurg, Panhala, Vijaydurg and Sindhudurg in Maharashtra and Gingee Fort in Tamil Nadu. “Every Indian is elated with this recognition…. I call upon everyone to go visit these forts and learn about the rich history of the Maratha Empire,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X. The decision was taken at the 47th session of Unesco’s World Heritage Committee in Paris on Friday night. In December last year, the Indian nomination for the Unesco tag had received a “deferral recommendation” from the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS). The Unesco advisory body had observed that India’s proposal for inclusion did not demonstrate that it had the “potential to meet the requirements for Outstanding Universal Value”. On July 8, Greece, in collaboration with South Korea, Kazakhstan, Kenya and Senegal, moved an amendment to ICOMOS’s draft decision that had called for deferring the nomination and proposed a two-phased nomination instead. The amendment, which was in favour of including India’s entry in the heritage list, said that the nomination fulfilled two required criteria. “The serial nomination of the Maratha Military Defence System of India demonstrates the successful application of military architecture dovetailed with planning, design, technological development, and military and governance strategies,” the amendment stated. “The 12 fort components are tangible expressions of enduring ideas of self-rule (Swarajya) and cultural resilience associated with the Marathas. These forts are central to intergenerational identity transmission, where communities actively engage to commemorate courage, sacrifice, and leadership models of the Maratha period,” it added. The amendment was accepted, and the Maratha forts were “inscribed” on the list. India had earlier this month gifted to all Unesco members a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji standing next to a cannon with a sword in hand. The Indian delegation, led by Permanent Representative Vishal V. Sharma, was present at the Unesco session in Paris. The delegation also included members from the Archaeological Survey of India, Union ministries of external affairs, culture and environment, Maharashtra’s archaeology department and the Development and Research Organisation for Nature, Arts and Heritage in India (Dronah), a private consultant. Sharma said the Indian delegation used a range of items to counter the deferral recommendation’s apprehensions. Besides the Shivaji statue, they included a coffee table book published in English, Spanish, French and Arabic, a replica of the octagonal Raj Mudra or royal seal of Shivaji, Himroo shawls from Sambhajinagar and notebooks with paintings of schoolchildren from near the forts. “It was an effort to introduce these (100) countries to the intangible cultural heritage of the Marathas and spread the culture of Maharashtra. The world is more acquainted with the forts of Delhi and Rajasthan, which are more flamboyant compared to the Maratha forts. Greece is an ancient civilisation like India and understands the Indian ethos. Greece was a natural choice to put our case forward as arguing our own case as a World Heritage Committee member would be a conflict of interest,” he told The Telegraph. Sharma added that except Turkey, which did not speak on the nomination, all others backed India.","The forts, built between the 17th and 19th centuries, are Salher, Shivneri, Lohgad, Khanderi, Raigad, Rajgad, Pratapgad, Suvarnadurg, Panhala, Vijaydurg and Sindhudurg in Maharashtra and Gingee Fort in Tamil Nadu",Environment,2025-07-16 00:00:00
IPL 2024: How Shubman Gill relied on slow and steady spin to sink big-hitting SRH,"Afternoon starts are usually tricky at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Who else would know that better than Sunrisers Hyderabad skipper Pat Cummins, who benefited by fielding first in the World Cup final for Australia but chose to bat first against Gujarat Titans on a similarly dry surface. It was the gift that Titans skipper Shubman Gill accepted with both hands. He had assessed the pitch correctly and had roped in the services of Afghan chinaman Noor Ahmed who replaced Aussie speedster Spencer Johnson. Noor struck in his first over removing dangerman Travis Head. Noor's more decorated spin partner Rashid Khan, who has endured a tough time post surgery, dismissed in-form Heinrich Klaasen and stifled the gifted Aiden Markram, to deny the Sunrisers any momentum towards the back end of the innings. Markram felt the pressure of accelerating and succumbed to Umesh Yadav as the 2016 champions ended up with a below-par total of 163. Even when Abdul Samad and Shahbaz Ahmed connected a few big hits in the end, Gill brought back Mohit Sharma at the right time and made the batters hit slower ones into the pitch to the large square boundaries and had the batters caught. In the last five overs, SRH could score only 40 runs. Gill may be a young captain, but seems to be quickly learning his trade.","Sunrisers Hyderabad captain Pat Cummins opted to bat first against Gujarat Titans at the Narendra Modi Stadium, a decision that backfired on the dry surface. Titans' skipper Shubman Gill capitalized on this, utilizing Afghan spinner Noor Ahmed effectively. Noor removed Travis Head early, while Rashid Khan troubled the batting lineup, limiting SRH to a below-par total of 163. Despite some late hitting from Abdul Samad and Shahbaz Ahmed, Gill's strategic bowling changes, especially reintroducing Mohit Sharma, restricted SRH to 40 runs in the last five overs. Gill's astute captaincy reflects his rapid learning curve despite his youth.",Sports,2024-04-01 00:00:00
Mumbai: Kidnap case leads police to black-to-white money racket,"MUMBAI: The city police claimed to have come across a racket where a trust and a private company were in the process of converting black money into white. The police stumbled upon the racket while probing a case of kidnap and extortion lodged by an agent, Amol Navalkar (35), against a marketing representative of the trust after the transaction fell apart. Cops from Marine Drive police station recently arrested the marketing representative, Sagar Hindurao Patil. An income tax official said, “It is a practice wherein a company donates money to a trust, which retains a certain percentage of the amount as commission and returns the balance in cash. The company can use the cash received to carry out unaccounted transactions and also get a rebate on the total donation made.” Patil, a Kolhapur native, has been booked on charges of kidnapping, wrongful confinement, extortion and threatening. Navalkar has alleged that in July, he was introduced to Patil and one Vijay Pandey. Patil and Pandey told Navalkar they were agents of the trust based in Karnataka and could help convert black money into white. “Patil told Navalkar the trust has Rs 100 crore cash while Pandey claimed to know a company that wanted to convert Rs 250 crore black money into white. They arrived at a deal wherein the trust would return the company Rs 100 crore in cash in lieu of Rs 250 crore ‘donation’,” said investigating officer Sachin Ghate. The trust promised Patil Rs 10 lakh as commission. On July 7, Navalkar, Pandey and Patil decided to meet at a restaurant in Churchgate to finalize the deal. However, Patil failed to turn up and the deal fell through. Blaming Navalkar for the deal collapse, Patil and his driver assaulted him and made him sign a document that said he was to pay Rs 10 lakh, said the police. Later, they forced Navalkar into Patil’s car, took him to Sahakar Bhawan in south Mumbai and locked him up in a room. “They assaulted Navalkar, took his debit card and withdrew Rs 30,000 from an ATM. They also got Rs 50,000 transferred into Patil’s relative’s bank account. Navalkar was released after he promised to pay the balance amount,” said senior inspector Vilas Gangawane. Patil then started threatening Navalkar and demanded the remaning money. Navalkar deposited Rs 2.80 lakh in Patil’s various accounts in Mumbai and Kolhapur and on November 5, he finally lodged a police complaint. Cops said they are probing the credentials of the company. “We will probe the role of the trust too,” said an officer. Patil’s lawyer Sunil Pandey said, “It’s a bogus case. Why did Navalkar not file a complaint for so long.”","Mumbai police uncovered a racket involving a trust and a private company allegedly converting black money into white.

Patil and Navalkar negotiated a deal, but when it fell through, Navalkar was allegedly kidnapped, assaulted, and coerced into paying. He eventually filed a complaint, leading to Patil's arrest. The police are examining the company's involvement and intend to investigate the trust's role. Patil's lawyer dismissed the allegations as baseless, questioning the delayed complaint filing by Navalkar.",Crime and Justice,2017-12-07 00:00:00

Shreyas Iyer is the best even in God's eye: Harbhajan claims divine intervention played its part after Kohli got injured,"Harbhajan Singh feels Shreyas Iyer scoring a fifty in the 1st ODI after the fact that he wasn't supposed to play was only possible due to a higher power. India's Shreyas Iyer scored a priceless 59 runs in the first ODI against England, playing a counter-attacking innings and breaking the back of England's bowling lineup comprising Saqib Mahmood, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, and Brydon Carse. However, his revelation after the game that he wouldn't have played the series opener had it not been for Virat Kohli's injury was a surprise. However, former India spinner Harbhajan Singh believes that divine intervention was at play as Shreyas delivered an impressive innings under pressure, turning the contest into a one-sided affair in favour of the hosts. Praising Shreyas as a proven performer, Harbhajan highlighted the batter's tremendous self-belief, suggesting that his confidence ultimately earned him success, especially when team management considered dropping him. He speculated that the only reason for such a move might have been the desire for a right-left opening combination with Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal. ""The team management has selected him in the squad but they had to decide whether they want to go with him or Yashasvi Jaiswal at the top. I think the team is currently trusting Yashasvi more. Maybe the management is looking to have a right-left combination up top. This is how the team went. But I think if the management wanted not to play Shreyas, then the only reason was to have Yashasvi Jaiswal up top,"" Harbhajan Singh told Hindustan Times on the sidelines of ILT20 in Sharjah. ""Shreyas is a proven performer. He scored a lot of runs in the World Cup. When a player scores so many runs, he thinks he would get opportunities. He is the best in his eye and hence, even God felt the same. He got what no one else thought and what someone else thought for Shreyas, that didn't happen. The player whom you were thinking about dropping, he played such an innings, he made it an one-sided game. The 50 runs he scored, changed the complexion of the game.""","Former cricketer Harbhajan Singh believes that divine intervention played a role in Shreyas Iyer’s crucial 59-run knock in India’s first ODI against England. Iyer, who was not originally slated to play, got his chance due to Virat Kohli’s injury and delivered a match-changing performance against England’s strong bowling attack. Harbhajan praised Iyer’s self-belief, calling him a proven performer, especially after his strong World Cup showing. He speculated that the team management considered dropping Iyer in favor of a right-left opening combination with Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal. However, Iyer’s innings turned the game into a one-sided affair for India. According to Harbhajan, Iyer’s confidence and skill ensured his success, proving his worth despite doubts from the management.

Indian students called it free speech. The government called it sedition.,"NEW DELHI — For two days police stood at the gates of a distinguished university in India's capital without being invited in. Inside, five students wanted on sedition charges were holed up, protected by private security guards. Just before midnight Tuesday, two of the students turned themselves in and were arrested, joining the student union president, who remains in custody. “People outside have to carry on the struggle. We will fight from inside,” Umar Khalid, one of the students, said as he was led away in the dark. For decades, India’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) — which sprawls across 1,000 leafy acres in Delhi frequented by roving antelope — has been an oasis of thought in the chaotic capital. It has long attracted many of the country’s brightest minds, who, under the sheltering canopy of trees, felt free to talk, sing, drink tea and debate the issues of the day — however radical their views might be. But since students chanted ­anti-India slogans at an event to honor a man executed by the government as a terrorist, JNU has become a flash point over freedom of expression in India. The fallout sparked protests at other campuses nationwide, raised fears of a separatist uprising and prompted a debate about what it means to be a citizen of the world's largest democracy. “JNU has been known for its vibrant culture, where all kinds of discussion and debates — from the extreme right to the extreme left — enjoyed space on campus,” said Nitheesh Narayanan, a leader of the Students’ Federation of India and a former JNU student. “Now there is an attempt to stop it.” Officials from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party said in Parliament on Wednesday that they had no intention of impeding free speech at the school.“This is not about expressing your point of view,” Smriti Irani, the minister of human resource development, said in an interview. “Free speech thrives at JNU. This is a law-and-order situation that needed to be dealt with.” The drama comes at a time when the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of undermining the autonomy of universities by trying to impose new subjects in the curriculum, appointing partisan leaders and working to curb activism.","In a two-day standoff at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), police awaited invitation to apprehend five students facing sedition charges. Protected by private security, two students surrendered, amidst protests over anti-India slogans at a campus event. Once known for vibrant debate, JNU now faces scrutiny over freedom of expression. The incident sparked nationwide protests and debates on democracy's essence. While BJP officials deny stifling speech, critics accuse the government of undermining university autonomy and activism. The incident underscores the ongoing struggle between free speech and government control in India's largest democracy under Prime Minister Modi's administration.",Crime and Justice,2016-02-24 00:00:00

Magnificent seven’ loom around uncertainty and turmoil amid Trump's turbulence,"Leading tech firms loom around economic disturbance and uncertainty as they set to report the first-quarter earnings this week. The return of Donald Trump to the White House is one of the key reasons behind the current state of these big firms. Reciprocal tariffs and unstable markets have impacted the performance of the global economy. The ‘magnificent seven’- which includes Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, and Alphabet (google parent), are the leading firms of the technology sector and firms have altogether seen a blow of 22 per cent, which is $3.8 trillion from its market value as of Sunday. “The mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,” said Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities. The current rollercoaster in the market stands in stark contrast to the expectations and optimism once showcased by the heads of these seven firms- Apple’s Tim Cook, Tesla’s Elon Musk, Google’s Sundar Pichai, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos — who appeared in rare harmony as they stood by US President Donald Trump at his January inauguration. The support of these heads was not only symbolic- rather it was rooted in a calculated move that Trump’s comeback would ease the trade regulations, earlier set up by former President Joe Biden. Rather than reaping the expected benefits, big tech now finds itself struggling to protect its footing.",Trumps' call to ban Nvidia from selling a key AI chip to China has resulted in a $5.5 billion charge tied to its unsold inventory of processors earmarked for Chinese markets.,SC,2020-12-09 00:00:00

The accused were produced in the court on the expiry of their 15-day judicial custody granted by it earlier. ADVERTISEMENT The police had requested the court on October 10 to send the accused persons to jail and had submitted that the agency could ask for their further custodial interrogation later. The police on Wednesday told the judge that it wanted to confront the accused with some protected witnesses and also some devices which were examined and the data that has been extracted.

categorisation of private schools for fee regulation sought,"Withthe new Government in place, the demand of parents to implement the fee regulation mechanism is increasing. The parents who have been fighting a relentless battle in the last ten years to see that the fee regulation mechanism was in place are upset that the previous BRS government did not take any steps in that direction. The Andhra Pradesh Education Act stipulates that every school should have a parents committee. The Telangana government which adopted the same act also has a proviso to constitute parents committee. But it was never implemented. There were several meetings of the parents associations with the authorities but all that they got were empty promises. The parents are now demanding the new government to come up with a concrete time bound plan to regulate the private school fees. They told Hans India that already the season for admissions had begun and the government needs to act fast. As of now, there is no scientific approach adopted by the schools and fees are increased as per their whims, allege parents and parent associations like HSPA. The HSPA has been demanding for categorisation of schools as it has been done in the case of professional colleges for the fixation of different fee structures under the supervision of the Telangana Admissions and Fee Regulatory Committee (TAFRC). In the absence of such categorisation, utilising the loopholes in the law, private schools were resorting to profiteering in the state. In the absence of fee regulation, parents are at the receiving end. What HSPA wants is categorisation of schools based on their infrastructure and faculty. Fix the maximum upper limit which should be subject to scrutiny by the State Level School Fee Regulation Committee (SLFRC). They further say that the fee should be fixed for three academic years. K Venkat Sainath, joint secretary of HSPA, said, this year we have filed a contempt case against the government for not implementing a fee regulation mechanism despite court orders. But the previous government despite forming a fee regulation committee, has re-printed what was in Andhra Pradesh Education Act (APEA).","Parents in Andhra Pradesh are demanding a new government to implement a fee regulation mechanism for private schools.

On the occasion, Chief Minister Pema Khandu, Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein and Home Minister Bamang Felix jointly called on citizens of the state to be equal partners in the development process. The trio highlighted that it was not the responsibility of the government alone to bring positive changes or development in the society, and suggested that citizens start performing their fundamental duties before pressing for their fundamental rights. The state leaders said that it was important to place the state first before the community or tribe for development in the true sense. To make Arunachal a better place, Chief Minister Pema Khandu also administered a pledge on HAA to a massive gathering of people representing different NGOs, student community, government bodies, CBOs and various civil society organisations from across the state. The pledge taken on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi Jayanti resolved on becoming a responsible citizen, to work for social harmony and to protect the environment. It also aimed to restore Arunachal its crowning glory and to make the state as ‘island of peace’. People gathered resolved to work as citizen police to maintain law and order and pledged to refrain from any illegal act. Earlier in his speech, the chief minister said the HAA has come into being to give thrust to the ‘Team Arunachal’ campaign. He said ‘Arunachal is a challenging state in terms of cultural diversity. So to bring the feeling of oneness among Arunachalees, not only the government but also people must take proactive part in it.’ He said to bring together all tribal communities, government exercises such as budget preparation involves consultation with all community bodies. This is to give out the message that Team Arunachal is a government represented by every section of people. The CM further said any breakdown in law and order discourages investment, which is vital for economic development of the state. To maintain law and order in the state, people need to be made equal participant, he asserted. The chief minister said the HAA will continue till 2024 without using a single penny from the government exchequer. He said funding for the campaign will be sourced from the corporate sector. Chief Minister suggested that HAA campaign should reach out to people on issues such as language preservation and promotion, drug awareness, prevention of money culture in election etc. On the occasion, ‘Picture Gandhi’, a bestselling book on Mahatma Gandhi, published by Tulika Publishers for children was released. The book has been translated to five tribal languages of Arunachal, namely Adi, Apatani, Mishmi, Nyishi, Nocte and also Bodo language of Assam. The book is originally written in English by award winning author Sandhya Rao. The chief minister also felicitated the six translators from six different tribes of Arunachal and Assam. Performances from various school, college and university students also gave a gist of the HAA, besides cultural troupes from different districts presenting the cultural diversity of the state. The Arunachal Pradesh Police, which will play an integral part in the HAA, also had a band and drill display. To mark Gandhi Jayanti, the Itanagar Municipal Council in collaboration with the district administration of the Capital Complex organised a Shramdaan at the park, where the chief minister along with his Council of Ministers, MLAs, chief secretary, DGP, senior officers and officials from the district administration and the IMC actively participated in the mass social service to get rid of plastic waste.

Institutional transformation for making a difference in education,"To create world-class institutions, it is essential to introduce the 4C's of institutional transformation, namely centres of excellence, sponsored chairs, consulting, and corporate classrooms, Nagendra V.

At the graduation day of the Coimbatore Institute of Management and Technology, he said these 4C's were based on some of the best practices of world-class institutions and adoption of these would lead to a difference in education. “Centres of excellence are physical or virtual centres focussed on specific issues. They concentrate on existing capacity and resources to facilitate collaboration across disciplines and across organisations on long-term programmes and projects of direct relevance to human needs and aspirations. These centres should serve five basic needs of support, guidance, shared learning, measurements and governance,” Mr. Chowdary said.

If you can make a difference to small shops near your institution, I am sure your consulting practice deserves to continue to exist. Then, it is a matter of scaling up”. On corporate classrooms, he said they were not about guest lectures and industry interactions. It was about delivering democratically designed course modules. “What it entails is engaging with a company on a long-term basis by chiselling a group of students as per a company's specific requirement so that there is a definite commitment on the board from both the company as well as the institution. These modules can be integrated by understanding what the company wants.

Don't test your child!,"Don’t let your child hit the panic button when exams arrive, says Norbert Rego Seven years ago, Mahesh Podar’s 16-year-old daughter scored 82 per cent in the SSC Board exam, with 92 per cent in science and 65 per cent in languages. Despite this, she couldn’t get admission to the college of her choice, which led her to end her life. Podar believes, “The exam system should be overhauled. Also, parents should not put pressure on children over studies. Sometimes, it’s very difficult to gauge the level of depression that children go through. Hence, they should be taught about mental health.” Today, Podar visits various schools in Mumbai to bring about awareness among children. Four years ago, Anthony Furtado lost his 17-year-old son to depression during the class 12 exam. He advises parents, “As exams approach, children should be told not to worry or panic, get stressed or depressed.” Furtado shares his experience with friends and strangers. He tells children, “Failure is always a stepping stone for success. Life is short and precious, live it. Life is beautiful, enjoy it.” Rima Nayak was in class 9 and tense about her exams. Her parents recall, “She found Maths difficult and the school threatened to fail her. One day, she took an overdose of drugs. In her suicide note, she said she hated school.” They are still in a state of shock, despite the incident happening three years ago. The common thread that runs through these cases is a poor understanding of a person’s strong points. Biologically, a child’s brain is divided into the left and right brain. Explains Dr Jitender Nagpal, psychiatrist, Vimhans Hospital, New Delhi, “The left brain develops analytical functions and contributes to numerico-mathematical functions with speech, language as also the primary functions. However, a collaborative partnership of the left and right brain is needed for holistic development.” Sharmistha Mukherjee, Kolkata-based clinical psychologist, maintains, “Right brain is responsible for visual and processes information in an intuitive and simultaneous way, looking first at the whole picture, then the details.” Dr R Manoj, Chennai-based clinical psychologist, says, “Experiments have shown that most children rank high in terms of creativity (right brain) before entering school. The limitations on the functions of right hemisphere comes from our academic approach which give excessive importance to mathematics, logic and language based on memorised information. Because of this, only 10 per cent of these children will rank ‘highly creative’ by age seven and it reduces to only two per cent of the population by the time they are adults.” Psychiatrists say left brain-dominant people take up professions like medicine, accountancy, engineering and law, while right brain-dominant one often pursue a career in the arts — painting, dance, music and sports. Parents should understand this ‘brain game’ and let their children explore their inherent talent. Tips to children - Study as much as you can. - Scan what you know well and read what you are not sure about. - Sleep for eight hours and eat well on time. - Play for half an hour, it helps memory and confidence. - View exams like a party, and answer the best question first. - After a paper, do not do a post-mortem. - Share your tears and fears with your best teacher, family members or a counsellor. - Play happy sentences in your internal iPod (brain) all the time. - When down, sad or scared, recall the time when you were at your best and play the memory completely. (Inputs from Shalet Fernandes, Mumbai-based clinical psychologist) Tips to parents - Talk less and smile more. - Hug your kid a little longer and a little stronger in distress. - Share your feelings with kids, encouraging them to do the same. - Encourage laughter in the family. - Discuss studies with them and discuss movies and fun too. - Help them recall positive memories. - When they are excessively quiet, irritable, have low or increased appetite, talk about death or dying, rush them to a counsellor and not to an astrologer. - Parents should sleep enough and eat on time.","Parents should avoid putting pressure on children during exams, as it can lead to stress and depression. Several cases highlight the negative impact of academic stress on students, even resulting in tragic outcomes. Experts emphasize the need for a better understanding of a child's strengths and advocate for a holistic approach to education. The brain is divided into left and right hemispheres, with a collaborative partnership necessary for holistic development. Parents are advised to let their children explore their inherent talents and provide emotional support during exams. Tips for children include studying effectively, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and seeking support when needed. Parents should prioritize open communication, encourage laughter, and be aware of signs indicating stress or depression in their children, seeking professional help when necessary.",Opinion and Editorial,2012-03-01 00:00:00
Pujara and Shreyas revive Indian innings with a crucial partnership,"A middle-order rescue act led by Cheteshwar Pujara (90, 203b, 11x4) and Shreyas Iyer (82 batting, 169b, 10x4) carried India to a respectable 278 for six at stumps on day one of the first Test against Bangladesh at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium here.

Reacting on the issue, Bhartiya Janta Party state spokesman, Vijay Bhadhur Pathak said that the manner in which the Government gave clean chit to the officials of UP Public Service Commission in the paper leak case, pointed that chief minister was not serious on the issue, and is playing with the future of the students. Pathak said that this is not the first time when fingers were raised on the functioning of UPPSC chairman and it’s secretary so they must both be sacked, if state government wanted to ensure a fair enquiry as well as to give justice to the lakhs of students who had lost trust in the present officials of UPPSC.","Both the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticized the state government's inaction in response to the paper leakage case, alleging widespread irregularities in recruitment, whether in the Police Department or for top state services, suggesting a deep-rooted conspiracy.

Govt asks industry to cut edible oils MRP by Rs 8-12 per litre as global prices drop,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Friday directed edible oil associations to further reduce the maximum retail price (MRP) of major edible oils by Rs 8-12 per litre with immediate effect, in line with the global market. ""Some companies which have not reduced their prices and their MRP is higher than other brands have also been advised to reduce their prices,"" the food ministry said after a meeting, chaired by food secretary Sanjeev Chopra, with the industry representatives. Price to distributors by the manufacturers and refiners also needs to be reduced with immediate effect so that the price drop is not diluted in any way, it said. It was also impressed upon that whenever a reduction in price to distributors is made by the manufacturers/refiners, the benefit should be passed on to the consumers by the industry and the ministry may be kept informed on a regular basis, it added. With the edible oil prices continuing to show a downward trend and set to witness further reduction by the edible oil industry, the ministry said, ""The Indian consumers can expect to pay less for their edible oils. The falling edible oil prices will help in further cooling inflation fears if any."" Industry representatives including the Solvent Extraction Association of India and the Indian Vegetable Oil Producers' Association were present in the second meeting convened within a month to discuss further reduction in retail prices of edible oils amidst a continued fall in the global prices. In the meeting, the ministry said the international prices of imported edible oils are continuing on a downward trend and therefore, the edible oil industry needs to ensure that the prices in the domestic market also drop commensurately. The industry was told to ensure the price drop in the global market is passed on expeditiously to the end consumers and not in a delayed manner as is observed now. ""The leading edible oil associations were advised to take up the issue with their members immediately and ensure that the maximum retail price (MRP) of major edible oils be reduced further by Rs 8-12 per litre with immediate effect,"" the ministry said in a statement released after the meeting. The international and domestic prices of edible oil were on an upward swing during 2021-22 due to many geopolitical factors including higher input and logistic costs. However, the edible oil prices in the international market are witnessing a fall since mid-June 2022, it said. ""The fall in the prices of edible oils in the domestic market is gradually being reflected in the domestic market. However, the government feels the associations can further reduce the prices and provide relief to the consumers,"" it noted. On the other side, the industry informed us that the global prices of different edible oils have fallen by USD 150-200 per tonne in the last two months and they have reduced the MRP and will further reduce it shortly. ""However, there is an element of time lag for reflection in the retail markets and the retail prices are soon expected to come down further,"" the industry said. Earlier also the ministry had convened a meeting with the leading edible oil associations and over a month the MRP of refined sunflower oils and refined soybean oil of some major brands was decreased by Rs 5-15 per litre. The similar decrease has been done in the case of mustard oil and other edible oils as well. The reduction in oil prices came in the wake of the reduction of international prices and reduced import duty on edible oils making them cheaper. The industry was then advised to ensure that the entire benefit of the reduced international prices is passed on to the consumers invariably, the ministry added. Other issues like price data collection and packaging of edible oils were also discussed in the meeting.","The Indian government has directed edible oil associations to further reduce the maximum retail price (MRP) of major edible oils by INR 8-12 per litre with immediate effect, in line with the global market. The move aims to pass on the benefit of falling global prices to consumers and cool inflation fears. Industry representatives were advised to ensure the price drop is passed on expeditiously.

DMK’s signature campaign against CAA begins,"The local DMK unit here kicked off the signature campaign against the Citizenship Amendment Act, after the party’s chief M.K. Stalin flagged off the campaign in Chennai early this week. The signature campaign that is set to galvanize the ongoing opposition to the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, and translate the opposition to the fraught Act into one crore signatures was brought to a start here at the roundana in the town on Wednesday. Communist Party of India (Marxist) State general secretary K. Balakrishnan visited the signature campaign site at the Five Road Junction near the roundana and affixed his signature before kicking off the campaign alongside DMK MLA and district secretary T.

According to Mr. Balakrishnan, if Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s government claimed responsibility for its so-called achievements, then they should also take responsibility for the scams played out under its watch. “They (scams) run deeper. Without the hand of the Ministers, no junior junior level official or a clerk will have the wherewithal to indulge in a scam of this magnitude,” said the CPI (M) leader. That is why, the CPI (M) has demanded that a CBI investigation monitored by the High Court should be ordered into the scams. Dubbing last week’s Central budget as a budget only in name, Mr. Balakrishnan alleged the government failed to raise the spending capacity of the rural poor, whilst giving relief to the corporates. “The allocation for MNREGS was far lower than last year. During the time, the majority of the country’s purchasing capacity plummeted, the prosperity of a few rich grew correspondingly,” said Mr. Balakrishnan. On the rising incidents of sexual crimes against children, Mr. Balakrishna urged the State government should stop viewing it as a mere law and order issue and instead take a holistic view by holding consultations with all stakeholders. “What does development mean, if we can’t provide safe spaces for the country’s children?”","February 05, 2020 11:55 pm | Updated 11:55 pm ISTThe local DMK unit here kicked off the signature campaign against the Citizenship Amendment Act, after the party’s chief M.K.

BJP rules out leadership change in Gujarat,"ahmedabad: the ruling bjp in gujarat on wednesday said there was no question of replacing keshubhai patel as chief minister following poor performance by the party, that suffered serious drubbing by congress in the recent by-elections in the state. gujarat unit bjp general secretary gordhanbhai zadhapia told pti that there was no alternative to patel in the state and it was under his leadership that the party got a thumping majority in the 1998 assembly elections. voices of dissent became prominent following bjp's embarrassing drubbing in sabarkantha lok sabha and sabarmati assembly bypoll last week and the speculation about the change in leadership was rife as patel was summoned to new delhi by party high command on tuesday. patel is scheduled to meet prime minister a b vajpayee, home minister l k advani and party president jana krishnamurthy on wednesday. ""by-election results cannot be a reflection of the performance of the state government or for that matter any government,"" he said, adding that in gujarat, there was the least chance of the result having any impact on the leadership. ""by-polls are not general elections. the fact that bjp lost the seats to congress does not mean that it's a vote against the performance of the patel ministry. one should not forget that the margin of victories in both the seats were not big. and bjp polled more votes in many assembly segments of sabarkantha parliamentary constituency, a congress stronghold, and to us it was an achievement,"" he added.","The Gujarat BJP affirmed its support for Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel despite the party's setback in recent by-elections.

APCC holds CM responsible for mess in Rural Works Dept,"The Arunachal Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) has held Chief Minister Pema Khandu responsible for the corruption while handling the PMGSY schemes in the Rural Works Department (RWD). “It is due to negligence and inept handling by the state government that the PMGSY scheme is failing”, the APCC stated in a release. “Due to large scale corruption in the department, there are complaints and counter complaints from various sections of the people in the state. The state government is absolutely failing in stopping corrupt practices in various departments including the infamous PMGSY scheme in entire Arunachal Pradesh. The state government has to be held responsible and must be able to reply to the electorates and people of Arunachal Pradesh”, the APCC said Asserting that no individual officer or minister can be singled out for large scale corruption in PMGSY scheme, the APCC said that the flow of transparency, corruption-free government and efficient administration depends solely on the 12 ministers, who are headed by the Chief Minister. Further, the APCC claimed that the PMGSY scheme seems to be coming to a total halt because of the indecisiveness, callousness and directionless attitude of the state government. “Taking undue advantage of such typical and sophisticated situation, the NDA Government at the centre has already stopped release of two installments amounting to Rs 250 crores last May and Rs 300 crores in August. Payment has been stopped due to various investigations and cases leveled against each other within the family of BJP and the government”, the Congress party alleged. The APCC has also held Prime Minister Narendra Modi responsible for non-release of funds at various levels, including PMGSY, adding that the contractors who have invested their money and machineries are now facing torrid times.","The Arunachal Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) blames Chief Minister Pema Khandu for corruption in handling the PMGSY schemes, citing negligence and ineptitude. The APCC alleges large-scale corruption, leading to complaints across the state. The party holds the state government responsible for failing to curb corruption, asserting that transparency depends on the Chief Minister and 12 ministers. The PMGSY scheme faces a halt due to the government's indecisiveness. The APCC also implicates Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the non-release of funds, causing difficulties for contractors invested in the projects.",Politics,2017-08-27 00:00:00

Denial will not help,"India has been rated the worst performer among 180 countries, ranked by an index of environmental performance put out by Yale and Columbia universities for 2022. Denmark tops the chart, with a score of 77.9, while India’s 18.9 is not just the lowest; it marks a decadal decline. The index uses 40 indicators in three categories. On ecosystem vitality, our rating was dragged down by a biodiversity drop, most acutely in species habitat, compounded by wetland, grassland and tree-cover losses. Fisheries, a strong point, saw a fall over the past decade. On health, while air quality was a big let-down, we notched up gains in sanitation and drinking water. We did rather poorly on climate policy, mostly with carbon emissions to blame. As is its wont, the government may be tempted to reject these findings as flawed. Every such study would have something that can be challenged. But the shock of a bottom rank, deserved or not, mustn’t detract attention from a need to double down on climate action. Energy shortages have worsened our economic trade-offs, and going green will be a stiff challenge. We must get our act together. And acknowledging a problem squarely is key to solving it.","India has received the lowest ranking among 180 countries in a 2022 environmental performance index released by Yale and Columbia universities.

Mohanlal to play Kunjali Marikkar in Priyadarshan’s next,"No other duo in Mollywood has arguably produced more hits than Mohanlal and Priyadarshan, and that's seemingly the reason why the two have decided to choose their next carefully. For their upcoming outing together, the director has zeroed in on a mega budget, period movie about Kunjali Marikkars of the 16th century.The director, who reunited with Mohanlal last year for the superhit Oppam, tells us, “We wanted to do a big film together next.As a result, we have been working on Kunjali Marikkar for some time. The research for the film is ongoing and it would take at least 10 months for that to complete.”Collecting relevant information about the period has been a challenge, he says. “What we could gather till now is information that is very much in the open and known to the public. So, we need to dig up more history.”Kunjali Marikkar was the title given to the naval chief of the Zamorin in the 16th century, to protect the coast against the Portuguese. There were four key Kunjali Marikkars during the era and Priyadarshan says that they haven’t decided which one Mohanlal will play.“The movie will be a mix of fiction and facts as information about many of the incidents that happened during the era is unavailable. It’s all scattered and we are trying to combine all of that and come up with a good storyline,” he says.Earlier, there were rumours that Mohanlal and Priyadarshan would be teaming up for a movie in which the superstar would be playing a police trainer. However, the director dismisses it. “That was one of the many scripts we have have heard. However, by the time I finish listening to a final script, I should feel a certain level of thrill and that didn’t happen,” says Priyadarshan, whose next release will be the Tamil remake of Maheshinte Prathikaram titled Nimir.While the Mohanlal movie will be his next Malayalam film, the director says he would be doing a Bollywood film before that.","Mohanlal and Priyadarshan, known for their successful collaborations, are set to work on a period movie about Kunjali Marikkars of the 16th century.

Satellite images flag ‘unusual’ activity at Iran nuclear sites hours before US airstrikes – Was nuclear material moved?,"The United States carried out a “successful” bombing attack at three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday — with President Donald Trump claiming that the locations had been “obliterated”. Operation Midnight Hammer involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers carrying 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs and more than two dozen cruise missiles launched by a US submarine. Top officials have since insisted that the attacks ‘set back the Iranian nuclear program by a very long time’. Satellite images however raise several key questions about the effectiveness of the US strikes. The US struck three key nuclear sites in Iran in the early hours of Sunday — Natanz, Esfahan, and Fordow. Six bunker buster bombs were dropped on Fordow while 30 Tomahawk missiles were fired against other nuclear sites. Experts, however, suggest that the US may have failed to impact the Iranian nuclear program beyond the obvious damage. According to images released by Maxar Technologies, the Fordow nuclear site saw heightened activity over the past few days — until hours before the US attack. Dozens of trucks were seen gathered near the entrance to the nuclear facilities between June 19 and 20 with heavy machinery and later appeared to move (mostly) northwest of the Fordow facility. Many on social media including geo-intelligence researcher Damien Symon have since flagged it as a “possible logistics shuffle” at the site. “The damage to the Nuclear sites in Iran is said to be ‘monumental’. The hits were hard and accurate. Great skill was shown by our military…A full payload of bombs was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. Fordow is gone,” Trump added via Truth Social. Similar images have also emerged from Isfahan with experts suggesting that the trucks might be sealing tunnels that serve as entrances to underground facilities used to store uranium, possibly in anticipation of an American attack. Satellite images on Sunday showed six deep holes in the ground around Fordow and ashy debris over much of the site. “There were trucks seen in imagery apparently hauling stuff away. One would assume that any enriched uranium stocks were hauled away…I think you have to assume that significant amounts of this enriched uranium still exist, so this is not over by any means,” David Albright — the president of the Institute for Science and International Security — told NPR. This seems important.

The facility was instead targeted by more than two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles, which hit buildings and tunnel entrances at the site. Isfahan is believed to have nearly 60% of Iran’s stockpile of already-enriched nuclear material stored underground. But experts who reviewed satellite imagery have suggested that most of the damage to the facility was restricted to aboveground structures.","The United States carried out a “successful” bombing attack at three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday — with President Donald Trump claiming that the locations had been “obliterated”.

‘You want my blood’: Who is Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s daughter T Veena facing ED heat?,"Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan claims the SFIO's investigation into his daughter T Veena is politically motivated. He dismisses calls for his resignation. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the Serious Fraud Investigation Office's (SFIO) action against his daughter, T Veena, in the ""illegal payment"" scandal was aimed at targetting him. Vijayan said, therefore, he was not taking the SFIO action very seriously. Responding to the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party's demands for his resignation over it, Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters, “You can keep hoping for my resignation.” The SFIO has reportedly named T Veena in an ""illegal payment"" scandal involving her now-defunct IT firm Exalogic and private mining company Cochin Minerals and Rutile Ltd (CMRL). “I know you want my blood, but you will not get it easily,” Pinarayi Vijayan replied on being repeatedly asked about the issue. On being asked why the party jumped to his daughter's defence, but the same stand was not taken when late Marxist stalwart Kodiyeri Balakrishnan's son was facing money laundering allegations, Vijayan said in that case, the CPI(M) veteran was not targetted. “Here, the allegations begin with the phrase 'my daughter'. That is the difference. So, the party has realised that in this case, I am the target,” the Kerala chief minister said. Vijayan also accused the media of hiding the fact that the payment received by Exalogic from CMRL was through proper channels, that it was not black money and that GST as well as income tax was paid in connection with it. He also accused them of hiding CMRL's claims that the payment was for services rendered by Exalogic. Vijayan said even his daughter's firm had given details of the services rendered. ""But, you hid all that. Why?"" he asked. Who is T Veena? The Indian Express reported that Veena has been under the radar of multiple central agencies following a 2023 Income Tax Department report on Kochi-based Cochin Minerals and Rutile Ltd (CMRL). The report alleged that CMRL made “illegal payments” worth ₹1.72 crore over three years starting from 2018-19 to Veena’s company, Exalogic, despite the firm not offering any services in return. The SFIO investigation reportedly found that Veena T had received ₹2.70 crore from a private mining company without providing any services, news agency PTI reported. According to the media reports, the SFIO investigation has uncovered a ₹182 crore financial fraud within the mining company, in which several others are also accused. It stated that the fraud was carried out by inflating non-existent expenses and creating fake bills. The Enforcement Directorate is also reportedly preparing to register a case against Veena T, who is already facing a probe by the SFIO in the alleged “illegal payment” scandal. The central investigation agency initiated a probe in March 2024 into an alleged illegal payment case linked to Veena, after receiving a complaint from Shone George — a Kottayam district panchayat member and son of veteran politician PC George, who recently aligned with the BJP. Shone approached the ED, demanding an investigation into Exalogic Solutions Private Limited, the IT firm run by Veena. There were also media reports that the Union ministry of corporate affairs has granted approval for prosecution proceedings against her in the SFIO case. Veena has often found herself at the centre of political controversies in Kerala, dating back to her college days. Her father, Pinarayi Vijayan, came under fire from political opponents when Veena pursued engineering in a private college in Tamil Nadu in the early 2000s — a move seen as contradictory to the CPI(M)’s then-stance against self-financing colleges in Kerala. Post-graduation, Veena worked at tech giant Oracle before taking over as CEO of R P Techsoft International in 2012, a Thiruvananthapuram-based IT firm under the Middle East-headquartered R P Group, led by billionaire Ravi Pillai, The Indian Express reported. In 2014, she stepped down and launched Exalogic in Bengaluru — a decision critics used to question the Left’s sincerity in promoting Kerala as an IT hub.","Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s staunch defense of his daughter T Veena amid the SFIO probe into the ₹1.72 crore “illegal payment” scandal signals not just a personal crisis but a highly politicized moment in Kerala's governance landscape. The Chief Minister’s refusal to consider resignation and his framing of the case as a targeted attack has escalated this into a significant political standoff, especially with the opposition parties pressing for accountability. 🧵 Key Points at a Glance 🔍 The Allegations Veena’s firm, Exalogic Solutions, allegedly received ₹2.70 crore from Cochin Minerals and Rutile Ltd (CMRL) without rendering any services. The SFIO and potentially the ED are investigating it as part of a larger ₹182 crore financial fraud involving fake bills and inflated expenses at CMRL. A 2023 Income Tax report triggered the probe, stating that no actual services were provided by Veena's company. 🛑 Pinarayi Vijayan's Defense Claims the payment was legal, taxed, and invoiced — not black money. Alleges political vendetta, saying the probe targets him via his daughter. Accuses media and opponents of bias, contrasting this case with that of Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son, who didn’t face the same party support. “You want my blood, but you will not get it easily,” he retorted to repeated demands for resignation. 🗂️ Legal Heat The SFIO has completed parts of its investigation and reportedly found prima facie evidence against Veena. The Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs has greenlit prosecution. ED case is likely following a complaint by Shone George, who is politically aligned with the BJP. 🧑‍💼 Who is T Veena? Former Oracle employee, ex-CEO at RP Techsoft, launched Exalogic in 2014. Her education and career choices have long drawn criticism from opposition parties — especially the CPI(M)'s past stance on private institutions. Seen as a tech entrepreneur, but has now become a lightning rod in Kerala's political discourse. 🗣️ What This Means Politically For CPI(M): This is a reputational blow during a period when the party is already facing heat over other governance issues. A probe into the CM’s daughter being linked to corporate kickbacks undermines the Left’s clean-image narrative. For Congress/BJP: This is political fodder during election season. The resignation demand is unlikely to go away soon. For Pinarayi Vijayan: His political capital may protect him in the short term, but repeated controversies involving his family are eroding his moral high ground. 🔍 What’s Next? April-May: More details likely to emerge as ED and SFIO cases progress. Legal action: If prosecution is initiated, this will become a high-profile trial. Political implications: Could shape voter sentiment in Kerala ahead of any major elections, especially with opposition sharpening attacks.",National News,2025-04-10 00:00:00
India must rethink trade strategy as US pushes reciprocal tariffs,"Columnist Amita Batra argues that the US's February 13 Executive Order marks a sweeping shift, imposing ""reciprocal tariffs"" based not only on tariffs but also on non-tariff barriers. India faces the challenge of analysing nearly 13,000 tariff lines for asymmetries in trade with the US. The column critiques the feasibility of India matching every US demand and highlights the challenges this poses for WTO compliance. Batra recommends that India adopt a strategic response: reassess its trade policy, diversify export markets, negotiate a sector-specific trade deal, and reform domestic tariffs. The article underscores the urgency by noting that the US is compiling restrictive measures across subsidies, exchange rates, and tax policies, making a broad “tit-for-tat” retaliation difficult for India.","Amita Batra's Business Standard column warns that Trump's ""reciprocal tariffs"" policy forces India to undertake a massive reassessment of its trade strategy.

Chidambaram should be removed: Joshi,"Moving from 2G to KG, Public Accounts Committee Chairman and veteran Bharatiya Janata Party leader Murli Manohar Joshi on Friday launched a full-spectrum attack on the UPA government and specifically on Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram. He demanded that Mr. Chidambaram be removed from the Cabinet for his alleged role not only in the 2G spectrum allocation case but also in the “latest” scandal related to gas in which the CAG has alleged that undue favours were shown to Reliance Industries Limited in its Krishna Godavari basin gas operations. Dr. Joshi cited the draft report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to demand that the government hold an inquiry into the “unprecedented leak,” adding that the leak could not have been made from the CAG office, and that the Petroleum Ministry must be guilty. It was a “matter of privilege,” he said but did not clarify whether he intended to take it up as a privilege issue. Since the issue was now in the “public domain,” the PAC would be free to take up the matter even before the CAG completed its report and submitted it to Parliament, he said. “Any member of the PAC can raise the issue at the next meeting,” which would be held later this month. Dr. Joshi said the Ministry needed to tell the people how long it intended to take before responding to the CAG's draft report. “Why is this delay?” He wondered why Mr. Chidambaram, who was Finance Minister at the time and a member of the Group of Ministers, had agreed to allow private gas companies to increase the price of gas to $4.20 per British thermal unit against the earlier ONGC selling price of $1.80. The decision to raise the price had benefited the private companies and led to a huge loss to the exchequer. What was the “formula” for determining the price of petroleum products, he asked. Mr. Chidambaram had not protected government revenues, he had “bungled” the list of the most wanted men sent to Pakistan and “now there was also a question mark on his election to the Lok Sabha.” “I demand that he be removed from the Cabinet,” Dr. Joshi said. Sources in the BJP suggest that Mr. Chidambaram is being targeted because of Hindutva terror cases against some RSS ‘pracharaks.' Some senior leaders have been trying to assuage RSS fears by telling them they are speaking to Mr. Chidambaram to “sort out the issue.” But the fear is that nothing concrete has happened to let the RSS completely off the hook on these cases. Dr. Joshi did not spare Manmohan Singh either, saying “as always, the Prime Minister keeps all such issues at arm's length.” He dismissed questions on the propriety of his using the BJP office to address issues related to the PAC's work.","Public Accounts Committee Chairman, Murli Manohar Joshi, demanded the removal of Union Home Minister P.

State gaols turn death traps for prisoners,"State gaols turn death traps for prisoners HYDERABAD: The death of 104 prisoners while incarcerated, made theprisons in Andhra Pradesha scary place in 2009-10.C N Gopinath Reddy, prisons department director general of police said the number of death of prisoners was high. The deaths could be attributed to a lack of doctors in jails, indifference at government hospitals to prisoners and a shortage of police escorts.On arrival, every new inmate undergoes a medical checkup, but may not always receive prompt medical attention as required.Of the 104 prisoners who died in the last year, 96 were in government hospitals, while others were in the prisons themselves. In a state known for its prison department reforms, the statistics are even more spine-chilling.In fact, Andhra Pradesh has been occupying the third place in terms of the number of deaths in prisons in recent years.The National Human Rights Commission (HHRC) has pointed out that out of the 1527 deaths during 2008-09 in prisons in the country, 287 were in Uttar Pradesh, 133 in Bihar and 131 in Andhra Pradesh.The latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report of Prison Statistics for the year 2008 said there were 1449 prison deaths. This includes, 295 in Uttar Pradesh, 144 in Bihar and 127 in Andhra Pradesh. Similarly for the year 2007, out of the total 1423 deaths in prisons, 180 were in Uttar Pradesh, 164 in Bihar and 117 in Andhra Pradesh.One of the biggest problems that jails in the state have been facing is an insufficiency of police escorts. Without the escorts, prisoners cannot be taken to government hospitals for checkups and treatment. Although this was taken up with the police department which provides escorts, the problem has not been addressed. For this reason, some prisoners who do require treatment cannot be taken to hospital.Sources have said that when prisoners exhibit no signs of serious illness, prison doctors do not take much interest and do not perform a thorough examination. In February 2008, Krishna, an undertrial facing murder charges at Chanchalguda jail, suddenly developed chest pain but did not survive even the ride to the hospital.However, another problem that reportedly blights prisoners is the lack of care provided to them in government hospitals likeOsmania General Hospitaland Gandhi Hospital. In May last year, a 45-year-old undertrial prisoner lodged in the Cherlapally Central Prison complained of severe chest pain, and although he was rushed to Gandhi Hospital, he died the same night.Many of the prison deaths are also due to Aids. When prisoners with Aids are admitted to hospitals, they (the hospitals) tend to give up on the patients, especially if the disease has progressed.""When a convict or an undertrial comes to the jail, he may already have a serious ailment for which medical attention is given. But what is important for us to do now is to observe if anyone could be suffering a mental trauma and offer help so that it does not lead to serious ailments,"" Gopinath Reddy said. There are more than 140 jails across the state and 15,000 inmates, most of whom are undertrials.","State gaols turn death traps for prisoners HYDERABAD: The death of 104 prisoners while incarcerated, made theprisons in Andhra Pradesha scary place in 2009-10.C N Gopinath Reddy, prisons department director general of police said the number of death of prisoners was high.",Politics,2011-06-01 00:00:00

Bollywood Is At Best Just Another Genre: Milroy Goes,"Starting off as a short film maker from the small state of Goa and emerging as the creator of an Oscars qualifying movie, Pervis Milroy Goes is a painter, film maker, writer and a lover of everything arts; an inspiration for many! Following the announcement of the book behind the fabled Welcome Millions movie, we reached out to him to get to know him better and explore a rising film maker’s perspective on the greater picture of Indian cinema. We all know the movie maker Milroy Goes but few know what made you who you are today. What was the behind-the-scenes of this brilliant film that is you? I have always been an artist. I started off as a painter, a sketch artist. But coming into digital art opened up the dimension of film making for me. What further fancied me was watching the making of movies; that was what pushed me into trying to make films myself and that’s how it all started. You’ve been into art your entire life but suddenly you decided to get into this really unique business of Cafe Bom Gosto! What was your vision behind that? In small towns like Cuncolim people generally prefer going to nearby cities whenever it comes to organizing meetings. Bom Gosto was a small effort from me and my brother to provide Cuncolimites a scope to gather their artistic and intellectual potential and discuss it all in one place. Having focused on Goa throughout your career, what have you observed to be Goa’s biggest strength that can take its cinematography to a global pedestal? Even though I have worked on and from Goa, I have always had a more global picture in mind. When I make films I make them for film lovers across the world and not just a limited region. I believe that is the biggest strength, not just Goans but anyone, can have in terms of making art. What changes do you think the Indian Film Industry is going to witness in the imminent few years? What changes would you like to see? I believe a lot in the potential of OTT platforms. Because in a state like Goa, where theatrical releases are only within the state, OTTs are a film maker’s window to the global audience. A growing focus on OTT platforms will surely bring about amazing changes in the industry. What are your thoughts on the regulations on OTT platforms? Do you think it’s important or is it going to curb a lot of creativity? I will only say that although some regulations are restrictive and may curb creativity, they are after all a necessary evil. When someone says ‘Indian film industry’ the picture that immediately flashes before the eyes is of Bollywood, while in reality it’s much more than that! What do you think is the reason behind this and what can be done to bring regional industries to the forefront? This is a question I really appreciate because, absolutely! People skip Indian movies a lot of times because they think it would come with the typical dance and drama. Bollywood is, at best, a genre. But it steals the overall identity only because it’s quite commercial and the name sells. Again, a shift in focus and more global outlook is the only answer to this conundrum. Speaking of Bollywood, it’s largely observed that the supposed superstars of the genre have this tendency to get into trouble all the time, perhaps due to a sense of power that does not just come from wealth. Do you think the growing influence of alternative platforms is going to put a stop to this false sense of power or will it go the other way and pull these developing platforms into the murk as well? Alternative platforms, in a bid to make their own brand, make big images out of small characters and this definitely affects these superstars. Even big actors are taking interest in serials now; again OTT platforms have a role behind this because they do not care about the commercial value of an actor but his overall ability. And I think it will change the Bollywood worship thing and will eventually clear out all the nuisance there is. Like you mentioned, it’s not easy for a commoner to get into the circle, let alone to the top. How do you, as a film maker, see this situation? The real challenge for a fresher is creating commercial value because a director would definitely want his film to sell. In such a case, it is crucial for an actor to be in contact with the right person who can provide him with his break. Is it challenging to find such able faces among freshers? It is but not in states like Goa. Because, unlike Mumbai, people here have more talent and less opportunity. And that makes it easier to find the right person. Nowadays we see a lot of artistic potential in young children get crushed due to a variety of reasons. Having been a social activist yourself, what do you think can be done to prevent these young talents from losing their wings even before they have taken flight? In this digital era, it is very difficult to manoeuvre youngsters into focussing on their talent in the first place. It largely boils down to the individual’s peer circle. When you have friends who share the same interests as you do, you learn a lot from them. One last thing that personally interests me is your announcement about the Welcome Millions book. Was it due to the pandemic or have you always been interested? What I originally wanted was to tell the real story behind the making of the movie to the world. But the pandemic sure gave me the opportunity for that and the fact that my brother is an author only inspired me further. That is how I became interested in the book side of it. Incidentally, it’s the pandemic that I have to thank for the inception of an idea like Bom Gosto! Do you have any closing words to share with our readers? I would like to say that if you think you have a certain talent, discuss it with people who are relevant to that field. They are the ones who will have the answers to all your confusion. Don’t let your talent go to waste! And above all, believe in your dream. Because when you do, “the whole universe conspires in helping you achieve it.”","Painter turned filmmaker Pervis Milroy Goes champions regional cinema and emphasizes Goa's cinematic potential. He sees OTT platforms as key for industry growth, despite potential regulations. Goes encourages aspiring talents to believe in their dreams and foster supportive peer networks.",Entertainment,2021-09-12 00:00:00
"Google launches Gemini chatbot app in India, with Gemini 1.5 Pro supporting nine Indian languages in Advanced version","Google announced the launch of the Gemini chatbot app in India, with support for English as well as nine Indian languages: Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. Android device users can download the Gemini app through the Google Play Store, or opt-in through Google Assistant. iOS access is expected in the coming weeks. Gemini Advanced will support the same languages and is powered by Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, its most advanced one for now. “With a massive 1 million token context window, Gemini Advanced now boasts the longest context of any widely available consumer chatbot worldwide. This allows it to process and understand vast amounts of information, from lengthy documents (up to 1,500 pages) and emails to even hours of video and extensive codebases in the near future,” said Google’s Amar Subramanya, Vice President, Engineering, Gemini Experiences, in a company blog post. With Gemini Advanced, users will be able to use AI to process multiple large documents; they can upload up to 1,500 pages, or they can summarise 100 emails.

From Espresso to Kahwa: Here’s how the world sips coffee,"Coffee is far more than just a beverage, it is indeed a tradition. The coffee culture around the globe is as diverse as flora and fauna. From the Turkish Türk Kahvesi to Arabia’s Kahwa, and from Italy’s world famous Espresso to Ethiopia’s must-try Buna, here’s how people around the world like to sip their daily dose of energy. Italy’s Espresso The best-known type of go-to coffee many of us rely on is the classic Espresso. This freshly brewed strong black coffee is what amuses Italians the most. Frappe or cappuccino belongs to their ‘later in the day’ choices. Turkey’s Türk Kahvesi The coffee choices of Turkish go well with their famous proverb, “Coffee should be as black as hell, as strong as death and as sweet as love.” The basic idea is to brew your coffee thick in a copper vessel called cezve with a generous amount sugar. Ethiopia’s Buna The roots of origin of Buna that is, coffee, lie in Ethiopia, hence, it forms a vital part of their traditions and culture. Ethiopians serve coffee with butter and salt instead of sugar. Saudi Arabia’s Kahwa Arabs serve cardamom-flavoured coffee, Kahwa with dried dates in order to counter the bitterness of the strong coffee seeds. Festive offer Ireland’s Irish Coffee Another type of coffee which has gained popularity around the world is the Irish coffee. However, the coffee that is served in the various coffee houses is far off from the traditional Irish coffee which is a blend of hot coffee, Irish whiskey and sugar topped with whipped cream. Mexico’s Café de Olla A spiced up version of the regular coffee, café de olla is brewed with cinnamon sticks in earthenware pots. Denmark’s Kaffee One of the world’s highest coffee consuming nations, Denmark is certainly a coffee freak owing to its severely cold climate. There are several coffee shops on every nook and corner across the cities in Denmark that offer their own special types of coffee brewed in a number of different ways.","Coffee is more than a beverage; it's a global tradition with diverse cultural variations. Italians favor the classic Espresso, while Turks enjoy Türk Kahvesi, a strong black coffee brewed with sugar in a copper vessel. Ethiopians, the birthplace of coffee, serve Buna with butter and salt. In Saudi Arabia, Kahwa, flavored with cardamom, is accompanied by dried dates. Irish Coffee, a blend of hot coffee, Irish whiskey, sugar, and whipped cream, gained international popularity. Mexico offers Café de Olla, spiced coffee brewed with cinnamon, and in Denmark, coffee variations abound due to the nation's love for coffee in its diverse forms.",Lifestyle and Features,2018-09-22 00:00:00

Top 10 health concerns of the decade,"After sharing and discussing with several professionals and housewives across the country, we confirmed these health concerns with experts in the line of medicine and health. Here are top of the mind health concerns voiced by men, women and also children. Heart diseases: Heart disease is the number one killer of both men and women. Now researchers say India, a country with more than one billion people, will likely account for 60 per cent of heart disease patients worldwide, by 2010. A study among Asian Indian men showed that half of all heart attacks in this population occur under the age of 50 years and 25 per cent under the age of 40, according to the Indian organisation, Medwin Heart Foundation. Although more men die of heart disease than women, females tend to be under-diagnosed, often to the point that it's too late to help them once the condition is discovered. Cancer: The good news is that survival rates have improved for many types of cancers in recent years. But, you can lower your risk by adopting a healthy lifestyle. Screenings also can help find some cancers early, when they are most treatable. Skin, lung, prostate, colon and testicular cancers are the ones that worry most men, while women feel anxious about breast cancer. It is second to lung cancer as the leading cause of death for women. Experts say the fear of breast cancer can sometimes be exaggerated, stopping women from going to their doctors for screening, or pushing women to make rash decisions about mastectomy, when it may it may not be necessary. HIV/ AIDS: The HIV/AIDS epidemic will affect women’s health in coming years. Rates of infection are found in population groups with certain high-risk behaviors (i.e., sex workers, intravenous drug users, and sexually transmitted disease patients). However, infection also is increasing in the general population. Despite the alarming growth of the epidemic, most women in India have very little knowledge of AIDS. Even among those who had heard of the disease, there were many misconceptions about modes of transmission. Swine Flu: Soon after the outbreak of H1N1 virus in the United States and Mexico in March 2009, the Government of India started screening people coming from the affected countries at airports for swine flu symptoms. Till date there have been 852 confirmed HINI deaths in the country confirms the health ministry. What begins with sudden chills, cough, sore throat, headache and fatigue, worsen and lead to death if not detected on time. Reproductive health: Many of the health problems of Indian women are related to or exacerbated by high levels of fertility. Research has shown that numerous pregnancies and closely spaced births erode a mother’s nutritional status, which can negatively affect the pregnancy outcome. Unwanted pregnancies terminated by unsafe abortions also have negative consequences for women’s health. Osteoporosis: A largely preventable disease, the behaviours that women develop in their childhood, in their adolescence, and in their early adult years really play a significant role in the development of osteoporosis. That's because bodies build up most of bone mass until age 30. Then new bone stops forming and the focus is on maintenance of old bone. It is never too late to keep bones strong and avoid fractures. Depression: Depression appears to affect more women than men. Research has proved that women need a connection with others in their lives. They need that sustenance and if they don't have it, they tend to get depressed. Unintentional injuries: Accidents, also called unintentional injuries, are the third leading cause of death around the world. They account for 1 of every 4 people treated in an emergency department. Death can result from motor vehicle accidents, falls and fires. Diabetes: More than 9 out of 10 people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Many men don't even know they have it until they develop problems such as erectile dysfunction, vision loss, or kidney disease. Obesity: A difficult condition to treat, obesity and overweight rates for children and teens have been steadily rising. Children who are obese face serious health problems, including asthma, joint pain, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes. In the poll parents reported that they discuss at length limiting junk food and physical activity. However, most do not curtail TV time","Health concerns among men, women, and children in India encompass a spectrum of issues, from heart disease and cancer to HIV/AIDS and swine flu. Heart disease, the leading cause of death, affects both genders, with Indian men experiencing heart attacks at younger ages. Cancer screenings are crucial for early detection, particularly for skin, lung, prostate, breast, and colon cancers. HIV/AIDS rates are rising, yet knowledge among women remains low. Swine flu outbreaks highlight the importance of timely detection and treatment. Reproductive health challenges include high fertility rates and unsafe abortions. Osteoporosis, largely preventable, underscores the need for bone health maintenance. Depression disproportionately affects women, emphasizing the importance of social connections. Unintentional injuries are a significant cause of death globally. Diabetes, often undiagnosed until complications arise, poses risks like erectile dysfunction and kidney disease. Childhood obesity is a growing concern, prompting discussions on healthy habits and limiting sedentary activities like excessive TV viewing. Awareness, screenings, and lifestyle changes are crucial for addressing these multifaceted health challenges in India.",Health and Wellness,2010-01-07 00:00:00

"India, UK reaffirm FTA commitment at Strategic Dialogue","India and Britain have reaffirmed their commitment to conclude a mutually beneficial free trade agreement (FTA) at the annual UK-India Strategic Dialogue here, as the two sides reflected the “good progress” on the 2030 Roadmap since the last review. Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra, who is on a visit to the UK, held discussions with his counterpart, Sir Philip Barton, Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) on Friday. After their meeting, the FCDO said the two leaders reviewed the progress made on the UK-India 2030 Roadmap since the last strategic dialogue in January last year and looked ahead to the next phase of bilateral cooperation. “The two reflected on good progress on the 2030 Roadmap since the last review, noting key areas where the UK and India have worked together to tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges,” the FCDO said in a statement. “This included collaborating on the world’s first malaria vaccine, working closely on India’s successful G20 Presidency and increasing opportunities for students and entrepreneurs under the Migration and Mobility Partnership,” the statement said. Festive offer “Alongside celebrating the milestones since the last review, this year’s dialogue included the ongoing commitment to negotiate a mutually beneficial free trade agreement (FTA) and enhance defence cooperation,” it added. Earlier, the High Commission of India in London said Kwatra also had a “fruitful meeting” with UK Minister of State for Defence Procurement James Cartlidge, during which they discussed ongoing India-UK defence capability cooperation initiatives and avenues for future collaboration. “We are delighted to host Indian Foreign Secretary Kwatra in London to underline the UK’s commitment to deepening cooperation with India,” said Lord Tariq Ahmad, FCDO Minister for South Asia, after his meeting with the Foreign Secretary, which his office said covered the FTA, migration and the Commonwealth. “I look forward to our relationship going from strength to strength, working together on trade, defence, climate, and health,” he added. The 2030 Roadmap was clinched between India and the UK in 2021 and includes commitments to deepen cooperation on health, climate, trade, education, science and technology, and defence by 2030. India and the UK have held 13 rounds of talks on the FTA. The 14th round started in January. There are 26 chapters in the agreement, including goods, services, investments, and intellectual property rights. The Indian industry is demanding greater access for its skilled professionals from sectors like IT and healthcare in the UK market, besides market access for several goods at nil customs duty. On the other hand, the UK is seeking a significant cut in import duties on goods such as scotch whiskey, electric vehicles, lamb meat, chocolates, and certain confectionary items. Britain is also looking for more opportunities for UK services in Indian markets in segments like telecommunications, legal and financial services (banking and insurance). The bilateral trade between India and the UK increased to USD 20.36 billion in 2022-23 from USD 17.5 billion in 2021-22.","India and Britain have reaffirmed their commitment to finalize a mutually beneficial free trade agreement (FTA) during the annual UK-India Strategic Dialogue.

"Brazil’s outspoken First Lady is coming under fire, but she refuses to stop speaking out","In early May, an air of triumph filled a dinner in Beijing, where Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva celebrated a diplomatic victory: businessmen travelling with him said they had secured billions of dollars in investments as the veteran leader renewed his international prestige standing alongside his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. But then Brazilian first lady Rosângela da Silva, better known as Janja, raised her hand. Although no one was expected to speak, Ms. da Silva addressed Mr. Xi, saying that Chinese social media company TikTok posed a challenge for leftists, claiming its algorithm favors right-wingers. China's President reportedly answered. The exchange was leaked to Brazilian media by the time dessert was served. Mr. Lula’s government is grappling with unpopularity that has dented his credentials as the frontrunner for reelection next year. Some analysts, including members of his government, attribute this partly to his wife’s perceived overstepping in what was once a ceremonial role. Ms. Janja, a 58-year-old sociologist, has drawn criticism for insulting tech billionaire Elon Musk, mocking the suicide of a pro-Jair Bolsonaro supporter and advising the President on how to use the military during the Jan. 8, 2023 riots in the capital, Brasilia. Still, she insists she will speak out whenever it serves the public interest. A Datafolha poll released June 12 found that 36% of Brazilians think the first lady’s actions hurt the government, while 14% say they are helpful. It was the pollster's first measure of the First Lady's approval. The same poll showed Mr. Lula with a 40% job disapproval rating, an 8 percentage point increase from October 2024. Brazil’s presidency said in a statement to The Associated Press on June 20 that Ms. da Silva adheres to the Solicitor-General’s office guidelines, adding that she “acts as a citizen, combining her public visibility with the experience she has built throughout her professional career in support of relevant social issues and matters of public interest.” Under guidelines published by the Solicitor-General’s office, the President’s spouse primarily fulfills “a symbolically representative role on behalf of the president in a social, cultural, ceremonial, political or diplomatic nature."" For many of her critics, this does not grant her the authority to speak as a government representative. Brazilian media have reported that government Ministers, lawmakers and staunch leftist campaigners are privately raising concerns about the First Lady being a hindrance more than an asset. These worries have skyrocketed since the incident in China — even as Mr. Lula himself has praised his wife for speaking out. “It looks like Brazil is governed by a couple,” said Beatriz Rey, a political science postdoctoral and research fellow at the University of Lisbon. “When (the First Lady) says there won’t be any protocols to silence her, she disrespects our democratic institutions for she has no elected office, no government position. It is not about being a woman or a feminist. It is undue interference.” Mr. Lula’s first wife, Maria de Lourdes, died in 1971. His second, Marisa Letícia, died in 2017. Mr. Lula, 79, and Ms. Janja said they met in 2017 and started seeing each other frequently during the leftist leader's 580 days in jail in the city of Curitiba between 2018 and 2019. They married in 2022. Many supporters of Mr. Lula's Workers' Party partly attribute the criticism against the First Lady to misinformation and disinformation. In May, the party launched the “I am with Janja” social media campaign in her defense. But the week-long effort garnered less than 100,000 views and only a few hundred comments. “Ms. Janja is an asset because she rejuvenates Mr. Lula, everyone in the government understands that, even her critics,” a Brazilian government source told the AP. “No one wants to alienate her. But many important people in Brasilia, friends and allies of Mr. Lula, do understand that by overstepping she brings some of her rejection to the President.” The source, who spoke under condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to speak about the matter publicly, often travels with the President and the first lady. Adriana Negreiros, a journalist who profiled the First Lady for a 2024 podcast titled “Janja,” said that allies of the President who criticize her do it with extreme caution. ”(Ms. Janja) dances, sings, speaks out, appears at official events and meetings with heads of state. She insists on being present and vocal,” Ms. Negreiros said. “There’s a lot of sexism and misogyny directed at her, no doubt. But not all criticism is sexist.” Ms. Da Silva said she doesn't go to dinners “just to accompany"" her husband. “I have common sense. I consider myself an intelligent person. So I know very well what my limits are. I’m fully aware of that,"" she told a podcast of daily Folha de S. Paulo. Ms. Da Silva did, however, express remorse during the same podcast for the expletive she used against Ms. Musk in 2024, once a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump. Many of Mr. Lula's adversaries say they want the first lady to remain in the spotlight. “The more she speaks, the more she holds a microphone, the more she helps the right wing,” said Nikolas Ferreira, one of Brazil's most popular right-wing lawmakers. Mr. Ferreira, a prominent social media figure, claims the role of regulating social media is a matter for Brazil's Congress, not for the first lady to debate with foreign leaders like Mr. Xi. Ms. Da Silva is also expected to play as a keen hostess at the BRICS summit in Rio on July 6-7, a role her husband is almost certain not to oppose. “She will be wherever she wants,"" Mr. Lula told journalists in March following criticism for sending the First Lady as his representative to a nutrition summit in Paris that month. “She will say what she wants and go wherever she wants.""","In early May, an air of triumph filled a dinner in Beijing, where Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva celebrated a diplomatic victory: businessmen travelling with him said they had secured billions of dollars in investments as the veteran leader renewed his international prestige standing alongside his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.

"Adyar walk track an obstacle course with encroachers, poor footpaths","Chennai: The city’s 8-km health walk track, which was inspired by similar facilities in Tokyo, is in tatters because of encroachments by commercial establishments and poor upkeep. Unveiled in Nov 2023 by sports minister Udhayanidhi Stalin, the stretch that starts and ends at Dr Muthulakshmi Park in Adyar has turned inconvenient and dangerous for regulars. Greater Chennai Corporation spent ₹1.4 crore on the health walk track. Officials said most of the money 35 lakh was used for view cutters (metallic barriers) to cover electric transformers. The rest went for nine benches, murals, median repairs, recharge wells and minor footpath repairs. On Saturday evening, TOI walked along the entire designated health walk route to find out first-hand what ails the track from Besant Avenue Road, passing through Church Road, Beach Road, and Fifth Avenue before entering Second and Third Avenues and back to the starting point. The arch, donated by Velachery MLA JMH Aassan Maulaana, itself is in a sorry state as the vertical garden plants atop have long dried. There is no footpath for at least 100m on both sides of the road. Then, a narrow footpath with broken paver blocks begins on the left side, but with impediments. Bunk shops and two bike showrooms on either side of the road have taken over both sides of the road, forcing pedestrians to use the carriageway risking their lives and limbs. “The carriageway is easier to navigate than the footpath. I have to get down the footpath and climb up whenever there are shops or parked vehicles,” said Sharmila P, a resident from Third Avenue in Besant Nagar. Footpaths widen a bit on both sides near Theosophical Society, offering solace. People feel safe and use the footpath at this spot. Soonafter, footpaths meander and narrow down till walkers reach the Besant Nagar beach promenade. The new footpath on the promenade is laid with slippery floor tiles which is hardly safe or advisable for walkers. When asked, GCC regional deputy commissioner (south) MP Amith said, “we will serve notices to the shops encroaching on the footpaths and make the track encroachment-free.” However, removing encroachments is not enough. “GCC should widen the footpaths and put-up street furniture and benches throughout the track,” said urban planner Santhosh Loganaathan. We also published the following articles recently Footpaths usurped, its no walk in the park for pedestrians in Lucknow marketsWalking in areas like Hazratganj, Aminabad, Charbagh Junction, Patrakarpuram, and Chowk has become nearly impossible due to crowded stalls, fast-moving vehicles, the lack of footpaths, and various other obstacles.107978227 BMC audit of city footpaths aimed at accessibility for differently abledBMC will audit footpaths to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities.

Indian origin astronaut-led NASA's SpaceX Crew-3 team headed to ISS,"Washington: NASA's SpaceX Crew-3 astronaut team led by PIO (Person of India Origin) Raja Chari are in orbit following their launch to the International Space Station on the third commercial crew rotation mission aboard the microgravity laboratory. The international crew of astronauts lifted off at 9:03 pm EST Wednesday from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket propelled the Crew Dragon Endurance spacecraft with NASA astronauts Tom Marshburn, Kayla Barron, PIO Raja Chari as well as ESA (European Space Agency) astronaut Matthias Maurer, into orbit to begin a six-month science mission on the space station. Chari is commander of the Crew Dragon spacecraft and the Crew-3 mission. He is responsible for all phases of flight, from launch to re-entry. He also will serve as an Expedition 66 flight engineer aboard the station. This will be the first spaceflight for Chari, who was selected as a NASA astronaut candidate in 2017. He was born in Milwaukee, but considers Cedar Falls, Iowa, his hometown. He is a colonel in the US Air Force and joins the mission with extensive experience as a test pilot. He has accumulated more than 2,500 hours of flight time during his career. Marshburn is the pilot of the Crew Dragon spacecraft and second-in-command for the mission. He is responsible for spacecraft systems and performance. Once aboard station, he will serve as an Expedition 66 flight engineer, and is scheduled to assume command of station for Expedition 67. Marshburn is a Statesville, North Carolina, native who became an astronaut in 2004. Prior to serving in the astronaut corps, the medical doctor served as flight surgeon at NASA Johnson and later became medical operations lead for the International Space Station. The Crew-3 mission will be his third visit to the space station, having flown on three different spacecraft, and his second long-duration mission. Marshburn previously served as a crew member of STS-127 in 2009 flying aboard NASA's Space Shuttle Endeavour, and Expedition 34/35, which concluded in 2013, using a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Barron is a mission specialist for Crew-3. She will work closely with the commander and pilot to monitor the spacecraft during the dynamic launch and re-entry phases of flight. Once aboard the station, she will become a flight engineer for Expedition 66. Barron was born in Pocatello, Idaho, but considers Richland, Washington, her hometown. She earned a bachelor's degree in systems engineering from the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 2010, and a master's degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Cambridge, in England, in 2011, where she was a Gates Cambridge Scholar. Barron earned her submarine warfare officer qualification and deployed three times while serving aboard the USS Maine. Her current rank in the US Navy is a Lt Cmdr. At the time of her selection as an astronaut candidate, in 2017, she was serving as the flag aide to the superintendent of the US Naval Academy. Crew-3 will be Barron's first spaceflight. Maurer also will be a mission specialist for Crew-3, working with the commander and pilot to monitor the spacecraft during the dynamic launch and re-entry phases of flight. He also will become a long-duration crew member aboard the space station. Like Chari and Barron, he will be making his first trip to space with the Crew-3 mission. Maurer comes from Sankt Wendel, in the German state of Saarland. Before becoming an astronaut, Maurer held a number of engineering and research roles, both in a university setting and at ESA. In 2016, Maurer spent 16 days on an undersea mission as part of NASA's Extreme Environment Mission Operations space analog. This mission is the first spaceflight for astronauts Chari, Barron, and Maurer, and the third for Marshburn. Marshburn is the sixth person to launch from Earth on three different spacecraft. During Crew Dragon's flight, SpaceX will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft maneuvers from its mission control center in Hawthorne, California, and NASA teams will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston. ""With Raja, Thomas, Kayla, and Mattias on their way to the International Space Station just days after Crew-2's return, we're seeing the power of American ingenuity right before our eyes,"" Nelson said. He added, ""NASA's partnership with SpaceX is not only critical for cutting-edge research, but also for international collaboration. The space station brings together nations around the world for the benefit of all. Godspeed, Crew-3 - I can't wait to see all that you accomplish."" The Crew Dragon Endurance will dock autonomously to the forward port of the station's Harmony module around 7:10 pm Thursday, November 11. NASA Television, the NASA app, and the agency's website are providing ongoing live coverage through docking, hatch opening, and the ceremony to welcome the crew aboard the orbital outpost. ""Ensuring our crews have safe transportation and continued access to space is an enormous responsibility,"" said Steve Stich, manager with NASA's Commercial Crew Program. ""We know the crew is excited to get on station and settle into their long-duration mission. The NASA and SpaceX team remains vigilant in support of their safe arrival and eventual return to Earth."" Chari, Marshburn, Barron, and Maurer will join the Expedition 66 crew of NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei and cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov of Roscosmos. Crew-3 is the second commercial crew mission to fly an ESA astronaut. ""It is always thrilling to watch a rocket launch, especially when an international crew of astronauts is sitting atop it. Matthias Maurer is the second ESA astronaut to be launched in a Crew Dragon spacecraft under the US Commercial Crew Program,"" said Josef Aschbacher, ESA director-general. He added, ""We are delighted to see him fly alongside NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, continuing a long history of international collaboration in space for the benefit of Earth. On behalf of ESA, I'd like to wish all Crew-3 astronauts a productive and enjoyable mission."" The Crew-3 astronauts will spend approximately six months aboard the space station conducting new and exciting scientific research in areas such as materials science, health technologies, and plant science to prepare for human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit and to benefit life on Earth. The Crew-3 mission continues NASA's efforts to restore and maintain American leadership in human spaceflight. Regular, long-duration commercial crew rotation missions enable NASA to continue the important research and technology investigations taking place aboard the station. Such research benefits people on Earth and lays the groundwork for future exploration of the Moon and Mars, starting with the agency's Artemis missions, which include landing the first woman and person of colour on the lunar surface.","NASA's SpaceX Crew-3, led by PIO Raja Chari, launched to the International Space Station, aiming for a six-month mission. Chari commands the mission, Marshburn serves as pilot, Barron and Maurer are mission specialists. Chari, Barron, and Maurer embark on their first spaceflight. Marshburn returns for his third mission.

"India, Saudi role crucial in global economy: PM Says Indian economy to grow at 7% this year","The role of emerging economies like India and Saudi Arabia would be crucial to the restructuring of the global economic and financial architecture, said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. “The integration of our economies with the rest of the world has created new opportunities and also brought new challenges,” the Prime Minister said here today. He was addressing the Council of Saudi Chambers of Commerce and Industry during the course of his visit to this affluent Gulf nation, one of the world’s largest oil producers and home to Islam’s holiest sites. “The global financial crisis has thrown up a broad agenda for global action and reforms. The role of emerging economies such as India and Saudi Arabia within the G-20 framework, and otherwise, will be crucial to the restructuring of global economic and financial architecture,” he added. Stating that the robust growth of the economies of the two countries threw up immense opportunities for business communities from both sides, Manmohan Singh said Indian investments into the kingdom had risen considerably and now stood at more than $2 billion, covering 500 joint ventures. Stating that India’s need for high quality modern infrastructure was vast, he called upon Saudi investors and entrepreneurs to explore investment opportunities in India. “I would specially refer to the construction, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, health, agriculture, energy, telecommunications, biotechnology, tourism and other service sectors,” he said. From India’s side, he offered the country’s expertise in the knowledge-based sector. “Education and skill development are of primary importance to both our countries. India has a proven track record in the field of knowledge-based industries, which have great potential for improving the skill set of workforce,” he said. “India would be happy to share its experience with Saudi Arabia in the area of human resources development,” he added. As for energy cooperation, he said conditions were ripe for moving beyond a traditional buyer-seller relationship to a comprehensive energy partnership. “Indian companies are well equipped to participate in upstream and downstream oil and gas sector projects in Saudi Arabia,” he said. Coming to the Indian economy, he said, despite the global financial crisis, “we hope to achieve a growth of over 7 per cent in the current financial year”. “We expect to get back to the growth level of about 9 per cent per annum within two years. Our domestic savings are high, and can support investment rates of as high as 38 per cent of the gross domestic product,” he said. Prior to the prime minister’s address, Saudi and Indian businessmen participated in an open dialogue moderated by Fahd Al-Sultan, secretary-general of the Council of Saudi Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Stating that the Saudi private sector was keen to have economic ties with India, Al-Sultan sought multiple-entry visas for Saudi businessmen. “We need Indian expertise to support our small and medium enterprises,” he said.","Prime Minister Manmohan Singh emphasized the critical role of emerging economies like India and Saudi Arabia in reshaping global economic and financial systems. During his visit to Saudi Arabia, he highlighted the increasing integration of their economies, with Indian investments in Saudi Arabia surpassing $2 billion. Singh encouraged Saudi investment in India’s infrastructure and diverse sectors, while offering India's expertise in knowledge-based industries. He advocated for a comprehensive energy partnership and projected India's economic growth to surpass 7% despite global financial challenges.",International Relations,2010-03-01 00:00:00
9 feared dead due to incessant rains; Shah assures help to CM,"The incessant rains in the State have claimed the lives of at least nine people, with some of them getting washed away in swirling waters while crossing streams. The bodies of some yet to be recovered. Among the victims were a couple, Yakub and Saidabee, working at a pre-cast cement bricks factory at Nayakangudem village in Kusumanchi mandal of Khammam. Their son Sharif managed to swim to safety wearing a life jacket dropped from a drone deployed by the police as part of a rescue operation. A man and his daughter, Nunawat Motilal and Nunawat Ashwini, 26, were washed away in Khammam, as their car was submerged in flood water while they were on their way to Hyderabad to catch a flight to Bengaluru. The body of Ashwini, who was an agricultural scientist at University of Agricultural Sciences-Dharwad, was found near a bridge on Sunday evening. Motilal is still missing. Khammam, Mahabubabad, Suryapet, Mulugu and Bhadradri Kothagudem were hit badly, with Khammam receiving unprecedented rain of over 52 cm when reports came in last. Revenue Minister Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy confirmed the death toll and said it was unfortunate that despite taking preventive measures, precious lives were lost. Kodad town recorded 296 mm rainfall in less than 12 hours, which is said to be the highest in the last four decades. Heavy rains cut off road connectivity to Vijayawada and further areas in Andhra Pradesh. Kodad police have asked people to reschedule their travel as the road is closed. A decision to open the road will be taken on Monday, according to Kodad DSP Mamilla Sridhar Reddy. Also, RTC services were suspended by both APSRTC and TGSRTC between Hyderabad and Vijayawada via Kodad. The Mannanur check-post on Srisailam road was closed following a landslide on the ghat road near Egalapenta due to the continuous rain. Deputy Chief Minister M. Bhatti Vikramarka stayed put in Khammam since Saturday night to review the situation. Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Amit Shah called Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy.

"PM, key panel seek overhaul of Indian defence production","New Delhi : On the eve of the 75th Republic Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has exhorted the armed forces, the military-civilian bureaucracy, and the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) to get their act together, erase cost overruns and project delays, and focus on making “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) a success in terms of defence manufacturing. HT learns that Modi held a high-level review meeting with top officials on January 13 and told them to ensure total accountability in Indian defence planning. The meeting was attended by Dr PK Mishra, principal secretary to PM, Ajit Doval, National Security Adviser, Gen Anil Chauhan, Chief of Defence Staff, Admiral R Hari Kumar, Chief of Naval Staff, Giridhar Aramane, defence secretary, and Dr Samir V Kamat, secretary DRDO and chairman DRDO, apart from other top officials. Although the details of the meeting are classified, it is understood that Modi asked those present to look at the long-term future of defence manufacturing, not merely the present, and conduct an audit of the platforms already with the armed forces before asking for more. He wanted accountability for cost overruns and delays in defence projects running into hundreds of crores and tens of years at a time when his government is keen to ensure the money saved can go into welfare programmes such as the PM Awas Yojana, which builds houses for the underprivileged. Rather than clear any new acquisitions, the PM wanted answers on how the armed forces handle obsolescence of platforms and accountability for accidents in which platforms worth hundreds of crore are destroyed or rendered unusable, people familiar with the proceedings of the meeting said on condition of anonymity. Modi’s concern over the Indian defence research and manufacturing came just two weeks after Prof K VijayRaghavan, former principal scientific adviser to the Modi government, submitted a scathing review report, “Redefining Defence Research and Development” to defence minister Rajnath Singh on December 30. The high-level committee has made critical observations about DRDO that need urgent attention and reform (see chart). The sum and substance of the report is that DRDO is taking on defence projects it cannot possibly complete in the timelines projected, resulting in heavy cost overruns and technological obsolescence even before the platform is ready. The 10-member committee headed by VijayRaghavan found that DRDO was top heavy with an aging scientific force that was not nimble and focused only on India’s western front (Pakistan) rather than being cognisant of the current threat (an ostensible reference to China). The committee also found that DRDO was reactive to what was being done in third countries with no plans to lead in terms of technological expertise or advancement; DRDO was in a “catch up” mode technologically, not “breakthrough” mode. The report comes at a time when India has sought to enhance domestic acquisition of defence equipment, and also make products for the export market. The committee, after talking to stakeholders in government and private sector found there was a no synergy between DRDO and the equipment users, two with the designer and the user mostly talking past each other, leading to lopsided development of platforms. The VijayRaghavan committee has made 11 key recommendations with implementation deadlines in the report (the longest is 180 days). The report found near total neglect of development of the national ecosystem for defence research with the private sector kept out, ostensibly in the name of national security. It found that DRDO’’s interaction with a resurgent Indian academia and industry was only in the early stages of a project and usually, of a token nature. The conclusions of the report and the proceedings at the PM’s review meeting suggest that DRDO needs a complete overhaul, armed forces need accountability, and national security planners, the vision to make “Atmanirbhar Bharat” a success.","On the eve of the 75th Republic Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi convened a high-level meeting to address concerns regarding defence manufacturing and the functioning of the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO). Emphasizing the need for accountability, Modi urged officials to tackle cost overruns, project delays, and technological obsolescence. The meeting, attended by top officials including the National Security Adviser and the Chief of Defence Staff, highlighted the importance of long-term planning and platform audit to optimize resources. Modi's directives follow a critical review report submitted by Prof K VijayRaghavan, which highlighted DRDO's shortcomings, including delays, lack of innovation, and inadequate collaboration with the private sector. The report underscored the need for synergy between DRDO, the armed forces, and private entities to bolster India's defence capabilities and achieve self-reliance. The recommendations outlined in the report aim to overhaul DRDO and enhance collaboration with stakeholders to drive innovation and efficiency in defence research and manufacturing, aligning with India's aspirations for self-reliance in defence production and export.",National News,2024-01-24 00:00:00

Muslim Youth League begins indefinite protest against CAA,"Governor Arif Mohammed Khan may have threatened Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan into submission using some tactic ahead of the former’s address to the Assembly, M.K. Muneer, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, has alleged. “Otherwise, the Chief Minister would not have rolled out a red carpet for Mr. Khan, who insulted the State’s concern over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), to address the Assembly. The Opposition members who prevented Mr. Khan were forcibly removed using the watch and ward personnel...We are ashamed of the Chief Minister,” the Indian Union Muslim League leader said here on Saturday. He was delivering a speech to open ‘Shaheen Bagh Square’, an indefinite protest event organised by the Muslim Youth League against the CAA on Kozhikode beach.

SC slams MP Minister Vijay Shah for remarks against Col Sofiya Qureshi,"New Delhi, May 15 (IANS): The Supreme Court on Thursday slammed Madhya Pradesh Tribal Affairs Minister Vijay Shah over his controversial remarks on Army officer Colonel Sofiya Qureshi. ""What sort of statement are you (Shah) making? Such a person holding a constitutional office is expected to exercise a degree of restraint. Every sentence uttered by a minister has to be with responsibility,"" remarked a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) B.R. Gavai. The Bench's observation came when Shah's lawyer sought urgent listing of his special leave petition (SLP) filed against the Madhya Pradesh High Court directing an FIR against him over his distasteful remarks. Senior advocate Vibha Dutta Makhija, representing Vijay Shah, said that the media overhyped the minister's comments, and he has already issued an apology. Makhija prayed for an interim order directing that no coercive action be taken against Vijay Shah under the FIR registered under Sections 152, 196(1)(b), and 197 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). Without passing any interim order, the Apex Court agreed to hear the matter on Friday, and advised the senior counsel to apprise the Madhya Pradesh HC about the listing of the SLP. On Wednesday, the Madhya Pradesh High Court ordered the Director General of Police (DGP) to register a criminal case against Shah within four hours and warned the DGP of contempt action in case of any delay in compliance. A bench of Justices Atul Sreedharan and Anuradha Shukla of the MP High Court said that prima facie, an offence of promoting enmity between different castes, religion and language was made out. The Justice Sreedharan-led Bench opined that referring to Colonel Sofiya Qureshi as a ""sister of terrorists"" is an offence of hurting the sentiments and faith of the Muslim community. Talking about Operation Sindoor, Vijay Shah, on Monday, had said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sent a ""sister from the same community"" as those in Pakistan to avenge the April 22 terror strike in Kashmir's Pahalgam. ""PM Modi is striving for the society. Those who widowed our daughters (in Pahalgam), we sent a sister of their own to teach them a lesson,"" Shah had said. The distasteful remarks against Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, the Indian Army officer who briefed the media throughout Operation Sindoor against Pakistan, sparked nationwide outrage. Following the incident, the Minister apologised from the ""bottom of his heart"" and said he respects the Armed Forces and mentioned Colonel Sofiya as ""sister"". ""I, Vijay Shah, am not only ashamed and saddened by my recent statement, which has hurt the sentiments of every community, but I also apologise from the bottom of my heart. Our country's sister Sofia Qureshi ji has worked rising above caste and society while fulfilling her national duty,"" he said in a video message posted on the social media platform X. In his petition filed before the Top Court, Shah sought quashing of the FIR as well as the suo motu proceedings initiated by the MP High Court.","On May 15, the Supreme Court of India sharply criticized Madhya Pradesh Tribal Affairs Minister Vijay Shah for his controversial remarks about Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, an Indian Army officer who briefed the media during Operation Sindoor. A bench led by Chief Justice B.R. Gavai rebuked Shah, stating that a person holding a constitutional office must exercise restraint and responsibility in public statements. The controversy erupted after Shah said, “Those who widowed our daughters, we sent a sister of their own to teach them a lesson,” referring to Colonel Qureshi’s role in the operation. The Madhya Pradesh High Court took suo motu cognizance, ordering an FIR under sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita for promoting enmity and hurting religious sentiments. Shah’s counsel argued that the remarks were misinterpreted and that he had already issued a public apology, calling Colonel Qureshi a “sister” and expressing shame and regret. The Supreme Court declined to stay the FIR but agreed to hear the matter on May 16, advising Shah’s legal team to inform the High Court of the pending petition. The case underscores the judiciary’s role in upholding dignity, secularism, and accountability in public discourse.",Crime and Justice,2025-05-15 00:00:00

The paradox in Chidambaram’s budget,"Here is a paradox worth paying attention to. Finance minister P. Chidambaram was able to keep the fiscal deficit for 2012-13 within the target he had set himself because total spending by the government was around ₹ 60,000 crore less than budgeted.One would have expected him to build on this austerity, even though it was led by curbs on capital spending rather than subsidy cuts. However, in the budget he presented on Thursday, the finance minister has indicated he will increase public spending faster than the underlying economy is expected to grow in nominal terms.","In 2012-13, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram maintained the fiscal deficit within his set target by underspending approximately ₹60,000 crore, mainly through curbing capital expenditure rather than reducing subsidies. Despite this austerity, his recent budget proposal suggests a departure from this approach. Chidambaram plans to accelerate public spending at a rate surpassing the projected nominal growth of the economy. This shift raises concerns as it contradicts the expected continuation of frugal fiscal policies. The paradox lies in the divergence between past conservative fiscal management and the current inclination towards expansive spending, potentially impacting the fiscal deficit trajectory and economic stability.",Business and Finance,2013-05-18 00:00:00
Six-pack abs are not my priority: Ali Zafar,"Ali Zafar drops his shirt for the first time but getting six-packs was not part of the plan Akshay Kumar and John Abraham got the mercury soaring with their shirtless act in Desi Boyz, and now Ali Zafar is all set to add to global warming by showing off his newly-acquired, toned bod in his next film. The actor, loved for his chocolate-hero looks, has opted for a lean mean look for his movie London, Paris, New York; BT gives you a sneak peek. Actors like John Abraham and Akshay Kumar have gone shirtless recently. You are now joining the league. Nervous? n I had done the same for my music video Ek Pal, so I wasn’t nervous about going shirtless. I had no qualms about doing it. I’d have felt weird if it was forced, but this goes with the flow of the movie. I have always been into fitness, but this time I have put in more effort. I had to get lean, but six-pack abs aren’t my priority. Did you hit the gym big time before shedding your shirt? I was careful about what I was eating. I cut down a bit on carbs. I didn’t stress too much about it. I have my own form of training. I like mixing aerobics, weight training and other things. I was staying opposite Hyde Park in London, so I would go there for a run. That helped me a lot. The day before you shoot, you do try and be a bit careful about what you eat. Are six-pack abs on your wish list? It’s good to have six-pack abs, but that isn’t on top of my mind. Every actor doesn’t need to sport six-pack or eight-pack abs. For this movie, I have tried to go for a lean, toned look. Some actors even get abs painted before a shot, but that’s not for me. I think it’s important to be fit and get under the skin of the character.

Off-campus centre in UGC list of ‘illegals’ cleared ahead of Modi visit,"With Prime Minister Narendra Modi scheduled to inaugurate the permanent campus of the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) in Bhubaneswar on February 7, the University Grants Commission (UGC) swung into action and granted approval to the institute Thursday.

Divided opinion over uniform syllabus,"Chennai: ""Many universities are already borrowing material from IGNOU, so having a uniform syllabus may help. Confusion often arises due to different universities having their own eligibility rules and this will be removed with such a move,"" he said, adding that credibility of the courses is another matter entirely. Ravichandran said that distance learning has become increasingly popular globally and more universities offering such courses had been established over the years. A minimum of 40,000-45,000 enrolments take place every year with the university, he said. However, the number of graduates varies as some students take many years to complete a course. The Tamil Nadu Open University has approximately 30,000 students graduating every year and offers courses from more than 20 centres in the state. Vice Chancellor of TNOU, M Bhaskaran, said that bringing in uniformity would be very beneficial for students as it would put them on an equal footing, no matter which university they opt for. He also added that there has been a sustained interest, especially with many homemakers and employees taking up distance learning. However, some academicians were of the opinion that this may not be a healthy move as it threatens the autonomy of universities. ""The concept of uniform syllabus ends at the plus two level and doesn't extend to the university level at all. It affects the autonomy of the universities and institutions cannot make independent decisions on how they want to offer the course,"" said R Thilagaraj, a Madras University syndicate member formerly with TNOU.","The University Grants Commission (UGC) in India is considering introducing uniform syllabi for all universities offering distance education courses. Dr. A Gnanam, director of Madras University’s Institute of Distance Education, welcomed the idea, stating it would help eliminate confusion and simplify enrolment processes.

Fake cheques eating into DVB’s revenues,"NEW DELHI: Touts are operating unabated at the local Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) offices in connivance with the staff. Last year, DVB cashiers in collusion with touts credited bogus bank cheques worth Rs eight crore. These fake bank cheques were deposited by the consumers to settle electricity bills and various other dues. Due to such incidents, the DVB has been incurring a huge revenue loss. While early this year, the DVBâ€™s vigilance wing was able to recover Rs 1.5 crore through special raids at the district offices in the east circle, DVBâ€™s losses have been mounting. Officials say since January this year, DVB has received fake cheques worth Rs three crore. â€˜â€˜Not only does it mean revenue loss to the DVB. It also institutionalises corruption in the electricity board,â€™â€™ said a senior DVB official. According to S K Mittal, assistant engineer in the DVB vigilance wing, the consumers who owe huge amounts often approach touts who promise to get their dues reduced. The consumers usually pay these touts half the amount they owe to the DVB. The touts, in turn, submit bank cheques drawn on fake accounts to the agency. The DVB cashier at the counter credits these cheques immediately, issuing a receipt of payment to the consumer. â€˜â€˜Since the DVB credits the cheques immediately and does not wait for payment from the bank, we do not come to know about the authenticity of the cheques till they bounce,â€™â€™ Mittal said.To make investigation on the bounced cheques difficult, the DVB cashiers often put wrong consumer (or K) numbers on the cheques. â€˜â€˜We often find these bogus cheques with the K number of consumers who have either paid their dues or do not owe anything,â€™â€™ Mittal said. Acting on the bogus cheque racket, the DVBâ€™s vigilance wing started a special drive in January this year. Three cashiers were suspended and 20 touts were arrested. The 150 consumers who paid through bogus cheques were mostly big consumers.","Touts, in collusion with Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) staff, are causing significant revenue losses through a bogus cheque scheme. Consumers, often large debtors, pay touts to reduce their dues, and these touts then deposit fake cheques which are promptly credited by DVB cashiers.

PM Modi’s roadshow creates saffron splash in Hyderabad,"It was a sea of saffron with Bharatiya Janata Party flags, Narendra Modi masks, baskets of marigold petals thrown in the air, orange balloons, saffron flags strung the length of the road from RTC Crossroad to Narayanaguda as Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit the final stretch of electioneering in the State. The State goes to polls on November 30. All the lanes and bylanes that meet the arterial road were closed for traffic between 1 p.m. onwards as double barricades were set up to create the corridor for the roadshow. The Narayanaguda and Chikkadpally Metro stations were closed and passengers were not allowed to board or de-board from the trains between 5 and 6 p.m. at these stations. Ashok Patel and his group of 35 people reached the Chikaddpally Metro Station by 2.30 p.m. They found a space to sit and watch the road show of Narendra Modi that was scheduled for 4 p.m. “We have come to see him. We will vote for him,” said Mr. Patel, a businessman from L.B Nagar who planned to vote for the BJP candidate from Maheshwaram. If Mr Patel and his friends came from LB Nagar, Ravi Teja came alone from Kukatpally to the roadshow. “There was supposed to be a roadshow in Kukatpally also but it was scrapped. That’s why I came here. Modi is the saviour of the country. Only he can save this country,” said Mr. Teja, who is a priest and solemnises weddings and other auspicious events. As shops stayed shuttered, some women dragged plastic chairs to wait the arrival of the Prime Minster. A bunch of party workers hired drummers and danced to the teen-maar beat while others played Hindi songs. Others brought political slogans and banners targeting the opposition parties.

"India, a bright spot for global investors: Modi","Positioning India as a ‘bright spot’ for investment in the current global slowdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that it makes strong business sense to be in the country, assuring investors of a simple and predictable tax regime as well as IPR protection. He also said that the Government hopes to roll out the Goods and Services Tax next year. “We have introduced the GST Bill in Parliament; we hope to roll it out in 2016,” he told top business leaders at the Indo-German Summit here, sharing the dais with visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Highlighting ‘decisive steps’ taken by his Government, Modi said that it was working on a new bankruptcy code, forming the Company Law Tribunal, and is keen to “see that genuine investors and honest taxpayers get quick and fair decisions on tax matters”. He said that the Government had taken a number of steps to remove long-pending concerns of investors, including expediting regulatory clearances, increasing the validity period of Industrial Licences across the board, and delicensing a number of defence items. “We have clearly articulated that we will not resort to retrospective taxation and reinforced this position by not going for the imposition of Minimum Alternate Tax on FPIs,” he said, projecting resolution of an issue that was of major concern for investors. “Thus, just in 15 months, we have successfully restored the credibility of India in the eyes of global players,” he told the business leaders -- the who’s who of the India Inc, particularly the IT sector, as well as the German industry. On Intellectual Property Rights, Modi said India is committed to protecting the IPR of all innovators as well as entrepreneurs, and a comprehensive National IPR policy is being finalised that would be progressive and forward-looking. “I can say that never before India was so well prepared to absorb talent, technology, and investment from outside.” Stressing that the necessary conditions to propel the Indian economy to a high growth trajectory do exist today, he said it makes strong business sense to be in India. “It makes even better business sense to Make in India.” “At a time of global slowdown, India represents a bright spot for investments. We are fortunate to be sailing in the right direction,” Modi said, but cautioned that “we cannot afford to be complacent”. On Indo-German economic partnership, Modi said it remained below its full potential. “We are particularly keen to develop the sectors where Germany is strong.” Projecting “immense” opportunities for German companies, he said they range from building 50 million houses to setting up 100 smart cities; modernisation of railway network and stations to setting up of new railway corridors; generation of 175 GW of renewable energy to construction of transmission and distribution networks, and building National Highways, bridges, and Metro rails. Five B2B (business-to-business) agreements were exchanged in the presence of Modi and Merkel at the event. In her address, Merkel said “Indian investors are warmly welcome in Germany. I can only encourage you to become even more engaged in Germany.” She also pushed for the resumption of negotiations on the India-EU free trade pact, stalled over a row over Indian drugs exports, saying it would not only pave the way for German companies to come to India “but the reverse is also true”. On bilateral trade volume between India and Germany, she said it hovered around 16 billion euros, and 2015 “promises to be a year of increased growth”. More than 1,600 German companies are active in India, with some of them even for longer than 100 years, Merkel said, adding, “our two countries are unified in the wish to build our relationship”. Merkel said she and Modi are working together for reform of the UN Security Council through the G4 - Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan, which support each other’s bids for permanent seats on the UN body. The German leader said she and Modi would meet again in November at the G-20 summit in Turkey. She said while India needs high-skilled jobs, Germany requires high-skilled labor. Earlier, Modi and Merkel visited the facilities of German automotive major Bosch here, with a focus on innovation and skills development. To further strengthen its presence in India, Bosch said it plans to invest Rs 650 crore (over 100 million euros) in 2015. During the nearly two-hour-long visit, the two leaders, accompanied by a high-level German delegation, walked through the Bosch Innovation Center and the vocational training center, enquiring about the company’s research, engineering, and vocational education activities in India. Merkel Visit “Productive”: Modi: Bidding goodbye to Chancellor Angela Merkel, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said her visit has been “productive” and taken India-Germany ties to “newer heights.” “As she leaves India, gratitude to Chancellor Merkel. This has been a productive visit which has taken India-Germany ties to newer heights,” Modi tweeted after the German leader concluded her two-day trip.","The article discusses a proposal by a task force on human resources development in the information technology (IT) sector to implement a cess for funding the training of tech professionals from smaller towns. This proposal comes in response to the projected shortfall of half a million tech experts out of the 1.48 million required by 2009, driven by the anticipated growth in revenues from the IT and IT-enabled services sector. The task force, led by industry veteran FC Kohli, foresees a need for 2.2 million tech professionals by 2009, including those in domestic and captive information services. The proposed initiative aims to channel industry resources towards smaller Tier-II and Tier-III cities to serve as talent pools for specific locations.

Gutsy Reddy's maiden ton keeps India afloat,"Nitish Reddy, an unknown entity in red ball cricket before the start of Border-Gavaskar series, virtually bailed India out with his dogged maiden Test century here on Saturday, severely denting Australia's hopes of winning the Boxing Day contest. Reddy's unbeaten 105 took India to 358 for nine, still 116 runs short of Australia's first innings score of 474 as rain brought an early end to the third day's play. With the flat MCG deck not offering much to the bowlers, saving the Test match shouldn't be a big deal for India. Reddy, easily India's 'find of the series', played a pivotal role in visitors' fightback. Reddy's combative spirit and the invaluable 127-run stand he shared with Washington Sundar (50 off 162 balls) proved to be the turning point for the hosts. Reddy's innings was termed as one of greatest Test knocks by the legendary Sunil Gavaskar given the situation as India were in a precarious position after Rishab Pant's dismissal courtesy a rash shot had left India tottering at 191 for six. The young Andhra batter could have been stranded on 99 when Jasprit Bumrah got dismissed, leaving Reddy with last-man in Mohammed Siraj, who walked in to another round of boos and faced three deliveries from home skipper Pat Cummins. Both Reddy and his father Muthyala's expressions changed with each ball but Siraj survived to allow Reddy savour the moment he must have dreamt a thousand times. A picture-perfect straight drive off Scott Boland was the moment of the series for India as Reddy balanced his helmet with the bat and took a knee, expressing his gratitude towards the Indian dug-out which gave him a standing ovation. The 21-year-had struck the 'Pushpa' pose after completing his fifty and aced the 'Salaar' pose to celebrate the century. A decade back, when his father Muthyala left a secured job to open a micro-finance (lending) business and incurred losses, the Reddy family was advised not to give wings to young Reddy's cricketing dreams but they were unrelenting. Sitting in the stands near the boundary, Reddy's father broke down when his son achieved the milestone. As Indian fans clicked selfies with him it must have reminded of the day when his son received the best U-16 cricketer award from the BCCI in 2017, and an impressionable Reddy was seen clicking selfie with his idol Virat Kohli and his wife Anushka Sharma while leaving the hotel premises. Reddy's batting was based on stable core, playing the ball late and only going for the drive when the ball was pitched up. He wasn't defending unnecessarily and 10 fours and a six was a testimony to that. If the morning was more about Rishabh Pant's inexplicable shot selection, the afternoon session belonged to Reddy, whose attacking game put the pressure right back on Australia. There were plenty of boundaries and a six off Nathan Lyon but none more gorgeous than the off-drive off Cummins. Reddy has been by far India's most consistent batter in the series and the maiden Test century couldn't have come at a more opportune time and that too at an iconic venue. Washington, at the other end, grew in confidence and trusted his defence apart from punishing the loose deliveries. It did help that the drop-in surface at the MCG has got better for batting as the match progressed. The second new ball did very little for Australian bowlers and the Indian duo ran very well between the wickets. With Mitchell Starc's back acting up a little, the two batters looked to reduce the deficit further. In the morning it was all about Pant's shot selection that hurt India. The third day's MCG track is perhaps the best to bat on with green grass making way for a brownish tinge and an old Kookaburra hardly doing anything. Had Pant stuck around, there was no way he wouldn't have scored big. Pant did start well and got a few boundaries but then the urge to play the falling lap pull over long-leg brought about his dismissal. When he tried it for the first time off Scott Boland, who came round the wicket, Pant was hit in the naval area and seemed to be in pain. He got up but didn't realise that Cummins had placed one fielder at deep fine-leg and one at deep third man for both the conventional and reverse lap shot. Without learning his lessons or caring about success percentage, Pant tried a similar shot but the extra bounce meant that the top edge flew to third man for a regulation catch. ""If there was a word called 'worstest', then this was one such shot,"" former India skipper Sunil Gavaskar said on air. But Reddy showed steely resolve as he started with a punchy off-drive off Lyon and also jumped down the track to loft him over for a straight six during a splendid recovery act.","Nitish Reddy’s Gritty Century Rescues India in Boxing Day Test A year ago, Nitish Reddy was a relatively unknown name in red-ball cricket. On Saturday, the 21-year-old from Andhra Pradesh delivered a defining moment in his young career, scoring a dogged, unbeaten century (105*) to help India claw back into the second Test against Australia at the MCG. India had been in serious trouble at 191 for 6 after Rishabh Pant threw away his wicket with a rash shot. But Reddy’s calm under pressure, alongside a gritty 50 from Washington Sundar, turned the tide with a crucial 127-run partnership. Their stand helped India reach 358/9 at stumps on Day 3—still trailing Australia’s 474, but no longer staring at an innings defeat. Reddy, who came close to being stranded on 99 when Jasprit Bumrah fell, got to his century thanks to Mohammed Siraj surviving a tense few balls at the other end. A crisp straight drive off Scott Boland sealed the ton—a moment that had his father in tears in the stands. Celebrating with trademark 'Pushpa' and 'Salaar' poses, Reddy's knock was hailed as one of the great Indian Test centuries under pressure, even earning praise from Sunil Gavaskar, who called it a “greatest” knock given the situation. His technique stood out—playing late, choosing the right balls to drive, and refusing to defend unnecessarily. With 10 fours and a six, it was a composed, mature innings well beyond his years. In contrast, Pant’s poor shot selection was slammed, especially after he ignored field placements and fell to a top-edged lap shot—drawing sharp criticism from commentators. While Australia still lead by 116 runs, the pitch has flattened and India’s fightback, led by its newest star, has kept the Test match alive.",Sports,2024-12-29 00:00:00

It is necessary to go to people to win the election. We hardly get 20 days for campaigning after party declares candidature, so we have to start our campaign before formal announcement,” Donga told TOI.

Another of Rajguru’s aide Vashram Sagathiya, opposition leader in RMC, has started campaigning from Rajkot rural seat. Congress leader Manoj Rathod is also pushing hard to get the ticket from the same constituency. “Every party members has right to campaign. They are promoting Congress, there is nothing wrong in it and there is no loss to party,” Rajguru said. However, senior party leaders in Rajkot disagreed with Rajguru’s view.

Disciplinary actions will be taken against those who are campaigning before formal announcement.”","Infighting within the Congress party in Rajkot has intensified as ticket aspirants have begun campaigning for themselves even before official candidate announcements for the assembly polls.

India must focus on protecting economy not on what rating agencies think: Rajan,"MUMBAI: India’s policymakers should focus on protecting the economy as businesses struggle amid the coronavirus pandemic instead of being overly focused on what ratings agencies think, former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan said on Thursday. “It is also important to convince both domestic and international investors that after the crisis associated with the pandemic is over, we will return to fiscal responsibility over the medium term, and the government should do more to convince them of that,” Rajan told the Global Markets Forum. India was placed under one of the strictest lockdowns in the world in late March for more than two months to stem the spread of the coronavirus, but cases have continued to rise steadily since the government eased restrictions in June, stymieing hopes of an economic recovery. The government has announced several initiatives to help the poor and small- and medium-size businesses, but actual cash outgo from the government’s measures has been estimated at just about 1% of GDP. Several attribute the fiscal prudence to fear of a downgrade after Moody’s cut India’s rating and outlook in early June followed closely by a change in outlook from Fitch. The central bank on its part too has reduced the key lending rate by 115 basis points on top of the 135 bps last year but decided to hold rates steady earlier in the day against market expectations as inflation pressures have risen. “The RBI and government have certainly been cooperating, but it seems like it is elsewhere, the ball is in the government’s court to do more,” Rajan said. He said the RBI needs to focus on whether credit is reaching the stressed areas of the economy and also if the viable firms were able to access credit and not the unviable ones. “And I think that’s where it has to focus its attentions, because resources, as you well know, are limited in India today.” To ease debt strains on companies and lenders, the RBI on Thursday said it would allow restructuring of corporate loans by banks, a move that was widely awaited by the industry. Governor Shaktikanta Das said there was room to cut rates further but the central bank will ensure inflation stays within its target range. Most analysts expect it to reduce rates once inflation is brought under control. Government officials too have suggested the possibility of any more fiscal stimulus being announced, would only come in the second half of the fiscal year, once a recovery has taken root and coronavirus cases have peaked. “What India should focus on at this point is protecting its economic capabilities, so that when it has dealt with the virus it can go resume activity in a reasonable way. That should be the focus,” Rajan said. “And if it does that, there is no reason why the rating agencies will not see that as an appropriate policy”.","India's former Reserve Bank of India governor, Raghuram Rajan, has urged policymakers to focus on protecting the economy as businesses struggle amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In an exclusive to FPJ, Architect Hafeez Contractor said that work on the project has already commenced and that they were studying the ground situation to come with a “unique and one of a kind master plan.” The Dharavi Redevelopment Project ""Our vision is a quintessential “Dharavi Vision”. No its not an extension of Bandra Kurla Complex or anything like it. Dharavi has its own beauty and charm and I can assure you that we will be designing it such that it will be an example for the world to emulate. The project is huge…there are so many factors that have to be looked into - the dharavi residents, their profile, sanitation, sewerage, homes, sunlight, playgrounds and what have you. Its challenging but beautiful. And the three of us (Contractor, Sasaki and Happold) are working together as a team with a holistic approach each knot and segment tying well into the other.” He added that because the project is so vast, no brief has been given by DRPPL. “We are studying the ground situation and coming up with the plan”, he added. He said that the buildings and homes will have so much space that even affluent housing does not match. “We want this project to be the best and we are keeping the interests of Dharavi citizens in mind”, he added. According to sources the three were hired for their services sometime last week and the brief given to them was that “they understand the Dharavi situation on the ground and come up with a detailed plan. We have left it entirely to them to make suggestions based on their observations. Yes it will be a mix of both commercial and residential,” sources said. Sasaki & Burro Happold Contractor has a track record of working on several Slum Redevelopment Authority (SRA) Projects in Mumbai and Sasaki is a reputed US based interdisciplinary design firm. Burro Happold, on the other hand is an international consultancy firm from the UK and is well known for its work in the field of urban planning and infrastructure engineering. According to DRPPL sources, Hafeez Contractor will be focussing on the building designs and Sasaki will prepare the master plan for the rehab and sale segments of the project in addition to amenities like roads, hospitals, schools, maidens etc. Burro Happold has been entrusted with the task of working out a master plan for all the utilities like gas pipe lines, water lines, gutters, sanitation etc. ""But all three will be making a detailed comprehensive master plan so that each aspect ties well into the other."" Experts from Singapore also signed up for project Experts from Singapore’s Housing Development Board who had played a crucial role in crafting over 1.2 million homes in the island city have also been signed up for the project. “Over the course of five decades, the professionals behind Singapore’s urban rejuvenation have garnered invaluable experience. Drawing on the invaluable expertise gained from their journey, the Dharavi Redevelopment Project aims to incorporate these learnings into its own transformational process. “, sources pointed out. They added that Singapore serves as an inspiring example for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project. In the 1960s, Singapore’s landscape was dotted with shanties, slums and ghettos, strikingly similar to today’s Dharavi. According to a DRPPL spokesperson said, “The Dharavi Redevelopment Project is more than an urban renewal… infrastructure – our goal is to elevate the quality of life of the residents of Dharavi while nurturing the essence of its vibrant culture. With a commitment to integrity, inclusivity, and community engagement, we approach this pivotal endeavour with world-class excellence. We anticipate the harmonious fusion of expertise from our world-class partners and the vibrancy and spirit of Dharavi’s citizens to cultivate a model of urban redevelopment that the world can look up to and can be replicated across other locations and cities.” The Dharavi area, spanning 2.8 sq km, often referred to as Asia’s largest slum, is set for redevelopment. After a decade-long wait, Maharashtra finally secured a successful bidder in November last year. Adani Realty, a segment of Adani Group, won the bid with an offer of Rs 5,069 crore. Adani Group's vision for Dharavi The Adani Group envisions an analogous renaissance for Dharavi: the creation of private homes replete with independent toilets, airy kitchens and rooms for family living and resting; emergence of bustling shops and thriving businesses; generation of vocational job opportunities; and upskilling of the local community. It may be recalled that recently Indian Mapping Industry leader Genesys International had been roped in by Adani Group’s Portsmouth Buildcon Private Ltd to deploy its digital twin mapping technology for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project. The contract was valued at Rs 22 crore. The mapping project is expected to be completed within nine months and will transform Dharavi's landscape.

"Damage control by PM Narendra Modi, orders Smriti Irani’s punish-journalist directive withdrawn","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday ordered the Information and Broadcasting Ministry to withdraw its order laying down new guidelines punishing journalists for fake news after widespread criticism that these norms were an attempt to intimidate and muzzle the free press in an election year. Soon after, the I&B Ministry issued a statement, saying its press release regarding fake news put out by it last night “stands withdrawn.” In the press release last night, the I&B ministry had cited rising fake news to announce that it had amended guidelines for journalists’ accreditation stating that if a journalist is found to have “created and/or propagated” fake news, the journalist’s accreditation will be suspended for six months or a year for a second violation or permanently cancelled. It had said that the Press Council of India and the News Broadcasters Association, the two regulatory bodies for print and TV media respectively, will determine whether the news is fake or not. And that the journalist’s accreditation would be suspended once a complaint is registered until either body decides — within 15 days — if it is fake or not. READ | In name of fake news, Government frames rules to blacklist journalists Media bodies and Opposition parties slammed this order calling it an attempt to curb press freedom ahead of the general elections in 2019. Clearly, the order from the PM was a snub to I&B Minister Smriti Irani who, until past midnight Tuesday, was stridently engaged on social media defending and explaining her ministry’s directive that was issued at 8.55 pm. Sources said that the PMO was “not consulted” and was unaware of Irani’s directive until it became public. “A fuming Prime Minister told his office to direct the I&B Ministry to withdraw the directive with immediate effect,” said an official. The Prime Minister, sources said, was annoyed with the “timing and tone” of the directive. “The feeling was that this is a time when the ministry should have been working with the media given the Dalit protests and the CBSE exam goof-up. Instead of protecting the government’s image, the I&B ministry dented it,” said a source in the government. Asked if the PM’s move was an embarrassment to Irani, the source said: “There’s no embarrassment when you correct an error.” At 12.02 am, Irani had tweeted to a journalist: “Accreditation committee comprises of editors, journalists and reps of PCI & NBA; do you think they will victimise one of their own? Also a celebrated senior journalist such as your kind self should support ethical journalism & not ‘fake news’.","Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered the Information and Broadcasting Ministry to withdraw its new guidelines on punishing journalists for spreading fake news after the directive received widespread criticism.

It also stated that two media regulatory bodies would determine the authenticity of the news and suspend accreditation until a decision is reached.

ndia's telecom equipment security may be key agenda during Obama's visit,"India's telecom equipment security may be key agenda during Obama's visit TNN | Sep 24, 2010, 06.27 AM IST Printed from NEW DELHI: India's increasingly rigorous telecom equipment security procedures could be one of key business agendas of US President Barack Obama, during his November visit. According to sources, the US government held an emergency meeting in Washington in the last 48 hours with vendors on this issue, displaying the level of discomfort of US firms with the Indian government's handling of its perceived security risks surrounding telecom equipment sourced from foreign vendors. Equipment manufacturers and software providers are largely in consensus that the current system is ill conceived , leaving firms like Cisco, Oracle, IBM, Microsoft , Intel, HP, Alcatel-Lucent , Ericsson, Nokia-Siemens , Juniper, and others badly scarred. This is the fallout of the Indian government's imposition of procedural restrictions without any open, transparent consultation process with the industry. Further, the engagement has shifted from the DoT to the home ministry for the first time, which is interpreted as an abdication by DoT of its direct responsibility. The correct course would have involved the DoT referring the matter to Trai before amending the licences. Trai itself, also failed to issue a consultation paper in this matter sumo moto, indicating all round failure in governance. Global firms believe the current system is at variance with international best practice and needs to be brought under the US-India Information and Communications Technology (ICT) dialogue. They fear that this flawed procedure will influence procurement first in other sectors and later in other countries which could become an insurmountable problem for them.

Plan panel seeks PMs nod to set up Mission NREGA,"Concerned that the government's flagship scheme, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), is witnessing see-sawing performance,the government is all set to put the programme in ""mission mode. If the Planning Commission has its way, then a dedicated Mission would be created,headed by an officer of the rank of director general, to spearhead the mission. The Commission, at a recent review meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, suggested that the flagship programme be placed in mission mode. We have sought the Prime Minister's approval for setting up the Mission MGNREGA, which would act as a support mechanism for the effective implementation of the Act by laying special emphasis on the neglected aspects of professional human resource deployment and capacity building,use of IT, and social audit. It is these soft elements to be met out of the 6 per cent allotted for administrative expenses under the Act that govern the quality of outcomes achieved through the 94 per cent spent on work.","In response to fluctuating performance in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), the government plans to establish ""Mission MGNREGA"" in a dedicated mission mode. The Planning Commission proposed the creation of a mission, led by a director general, to enhance the effective implementation of the flagship program. The mission aims to address neglected aspects such as professional human resource deployment, capacity building, IT utilization, and social audit.

Pilgrims' movement to be tracked using wireless devices,"With a view to ensuring a safe and smooth journey of the Greater Himalayas, the authorities concerned will track the movements of the pilgrims of the Holy Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage during their Himalayan sojourn with the help of wireless communication devices, putting in place necessary ground safety staff. “Each batch of the pilgrims of the Holi Kailash Mansarovar 'yatra' accompanied by security staff on way to the Kailash Mansarovar will be equipped with wireless sets,” said R l Sharma, Superintendent of Police , Pithoragarh. More so, he added, “necessary police force will also be deployed on all important destinations on way to the Kailash Mansarovar to ensure a safe and hassle free pilgrimage for the devotees.” Owing to poor communication network in the upper Himalayan ranges, wireless communication devices are being used to strengthen the communication services there during the Kailash Mansarovar yatra which is likely to begin on June 12. In the meantime, the district administration Pithoragarh has also directed the officials concerned of various departments like PWD, health to name a few to take necessary steps to strengthen basic infrastructure on the Kailash Mansarovar route so that the said annual pilgrimage could be completed in a smooth and safe manner. It is worth mentioning here that the Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam(KMVN) looks after the hospitality aspect including travelling of this Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage. “As many as 18 batches i.e. 60 pilgrims in each batch, would go on the holy Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage this year too, as the officials concerned of the KMVN informed. It is to note that earlier only 16 batches of pilgrims used to go on this annual Holy Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage. But from last year, the number of batches of pilgrims has been raised upto 18. So, this year too as many as 18 batches of pilgrims would be sent on this pilgrimage,” added the officials concerned. It is also to note that whereas earlier the said pilgrimage used to commence from New Delhi on June 1, since last year the timing of the said holy pilgrimage had been rescheduled starting it from June 12. So timing of commencement of this aforesaid holy pilgrimage will remain same i.e. June 12 this year too. The pilgrimage of the Kailash Mansarovar commences from New Delhi and is conducted under the overall supervision of the Ministry of External Affairs. At the same time the pilgrimage route starts from New Delhi to the Kailash Mansarovar via different hill tourist destinations ncluding Almora, Dharchula, Narayan Ashram, Sirkha, Gala, Bundi, Gunji, Nabhidhang, lipupass and then the holy shrine, Kailash Mansarovar. It may be recalled that last year the holy Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage had to be cut short on account of devastating natural disaster that Uttarakahnd had to face during monsoon season. But this year, as the officials concerned hope, the pilgrimage would be completed smoothly. So keeping in view the past experiences the authorities concerned seem to have put the safety measures like use of modern wireless network in place, apart from deployment of necessary manpower including security staff for safety and security of the pilgrims.","To ensure the safety and smooth journey of pilgrims on the Holy Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, authorities will use wireless communication devices and deploy necessary ground safety staff. Each batch of pilgrims, accompanied by security personnel, will be equipped with wireless sets to strengthen communication in the poorly networked upper Himalayan ranges. The pilgrimage, beginning on June 12, will have 18 batches of 60 pilgrims each, an increase from the previous 16 batches. Pithoragarh's Superintendent of Police, R.L. Sharma, stated that police forces will be deployed at key points along the route. The district administration has also instructed departments like PWD and health to enhance basic infrastructure along the route. The Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (KMVN) will manage hospitality and travel arrangements. The pilgrimage, overseen by the Ministry of External Affairs, starts from New Delhi and passes through several hill destinations including Almora, Dharchula, Narayan Ashram, and others before reaching Kailash Mansarovar. Last year's pilgrimage was cut short due to a natural disaster in Uttarakhand, but officials are hopeful for a smooth journey this year. Enhanced safety measures, such as modern wireless networks and additional security staff, have been put in place based on past experiences.",Local News,2014-05-31 00:00:00
Russian Hackers Were Inside Ukraine's Telecom Systems For Months: Report,"NEW DELHI: In one of the most dramatic hacking incidents since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian hackers remained inside Ukrainian telecoms giant Kyvistar's system since May 2023, reported news agency Reuters quoting Kyiv's cyber spy chief.The same hackers on December 12 disrupted the services that Ukraine's biggest telecoms operator provides to around 24 million users. The Ukrainian spy chief said the incident should serve as a ""big warning"" to the West. In an interview, Illia Vitiuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine's (SBU) cybersecurity department, disclosed exclusive details about the hack, which he said caused ""disastrous destruction and aimed to land a psychological blow and gather intelligence"".""This attack is a big message, a big warning, not only to Ukraine, but for the whole Western world to understand that no one is actually untouchable,"" he told Reuters.Vitiuk claimed that the attack wiped ""almost everything"", including thousands of virtual servers and PCs from the database of Kyvistar, the company he stressed had invested a lot in cybersecurity. He described the cyber attack as the first instance that ""completely destroyed the core of a telecoms operator."" During its investigation, the SBU found the hackers probably attempted to penetrate Kyivstar in March or earlier, he said in a Zoom interview on December 27.""For now, we can say securely, that they were in the system at least since May 2023,"" he said. ""I cannot say right now, since what time they had ... full access: probably at least since November,"" he added. He said that the SBU evaluated that the hackers possessed the capability to pilfer personal information, discern the locations of phones, intercept SMS messages, and potentially seize Telegram accounts given the extent of access they obtained.A Kyivstar spokesperson told the news agency that the company was ""working closely with the SBU to investigate the attack and would take all necessary steps to eliminate future risks"". The spokesperson said, ""No facts of leakage of personal and subscriber data have been revealed."" Vitiuk said the SBU helped Kyivstar restore its systems within days and repel new cyber attacks. ""After the major break there were a number of new attempts aimed at dealing more damage to the operator,"" he said.The investigation into the attack has become more challenging due to the wiping of Kyivstar's infrastructure. Vitiuk expressed a high level of certainty that the responsible party was Sandworm, a cyberwarfare unit affiliated with Russian military intelligence, known for its involvement in cyberattacks in Ukraine and other regions. Meanwhile, Russia's defence ministry has not responded to a request for comment on Vitiuk's remarks.","Russian hackers, likely linked to Sandworm cyberwarfare unit, infiltrated Ukraine's Kyivstar telecom since May 2023, launching a major attack on December 12, disrupting services for 24 million users.

"Tax department gets a ₹10,000 cr windfall from pact with MNCs","The income tax department has made a windfall gain of ₹10,000 crore from a scheme meant to avoid tax disputes, with multinational companies operating in India, a development that could give impetus to new schemes that will reduce litigation while adding to the government coffers. The gain is from the advance pricing agreement (APA) programme that allows MNCs to negotiate how profit margins for India operations are to be calculated for tax purposes for five years in return for avoiding rigorous scrutiny of transaction details. Introduced in 2012, the scheme was tweaked in 2015 to allow such negotiated profit margins applicable for the past four years as well, allowing companies tax certainty for a total of nine years. Extending the agreed profit margin for past years has led to many MNCs revising their past year profit margins upwards, a government official said on condition of anonymity. Questioning the price at which MNCs transact with their units in India, called transfer price, has been an area of intense tax disputes at the beginning of this decade, which forced the government to roll out the APA scheme. Companies such as International Business Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp. had in the past faced transfer pricing disputes in India. “In the retroactive APAs, when companies agree for, say, 16% profit margin, and revise past years’ profit margin to 16% from a previously disclosed 14% to secure certainty in taxation, the department has benefited. So far, the estimate is that the department has benefited by more than ₹10,000 crore, with about 320 APAs having been signed till 2019,” said the official cited earlier. Close to 60 more APAs have been cleared by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and are waiting to be signed, said the official. The price at which MNCs transact with their associated enterprises across the border is of key interest to the tax department as any profits that are not taxed here would erode the country’s tax base. Tax officials verify that the cross-border transactions are on an arm’s length basis by comparing them with the industry benchmark or margins in similar transactions between unrelated parties. India’s services sector, especially the information technology industry, had in the past borne the brunt of taxmen upwardly revising the profits reported here, known as transfer pricing adjustments. The success of the APA scheme is likely to give impetus to others that could reduce the cost of tax collection and at the same time, offer tax certainty to businesses. A seven-member task force, led by former CBDT member Akhilesh Ranjan, had suggested to the government in its report last year that the concept of mediation could be introduced in law to resolve tax disputes. The finance ministry has not made the report public yet, but is widely expected to rely on the ideas suggested by it in shaping tax proposals in the union budget for FY21. “Barring a few extreme cases, industry has generally been happy about the outcome of the APA programme. This could encourage the government to come up with more schemes meant to reduce litigation,” said Amit Maheshwari, partner at Ashok Maheshwary and Associates Llp. Although the APA scheme has been a success, making the tax authorities in other countries, where the MNC has units, parties to such deals has not seen a similar degree of success. While the APA scheme offers tax certainty only within India, a bilateral or multilateral APA would offer relief to the company from double taxation as well.","The income tax department in India has reportedly gained a windfall of ₹10,000 crore ($1.36 billion) from the Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) program, aimed at avoiding tax disputes with multinational companies (MNCs) operating in India. The APA program allows MNCs to negotiate profit margins for their India operations for tax purposes, providing tax certainty for up to nine years. The success of the program could prompt the government to introduce more schemes aimed at reducing litigation and offering tax certainty to businesses. A task force has suggested introducing mediation to resolve tax disputes.",Business and Finance,2020-01-27 00:00:00
Resetting India-China ties,"The foreign policy establishment in New Delhi, especially scholars and experts dealing with China are making for the setting of ‘reset' button between the two countries. Despite differences over issues like India's membership to the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the listing of Masood Azhar as a global terrorist, the CPEC and widening trade deficit with India, the 73-day long Doklam standoff was no less a reflection of ‘low point' in India-China relations. Post-Doklam the timeline witnessed apparent expression from India to put the bilateral relations on track, with more ‘sincere and cultivated efforts', keeping in mind the existing power gap. Despite these efforts, mutual ties slipped down in the last years, thus making way for an 'informal meeting' between the leadership of both countries. In last couple of months, a number of high-level visits have taken place between both the countries. leaders of both countries reiterated in their meetings at Astana and Xiamen that differences must not be allowed to become a dispute. In December 2017, Vice Chairman of Niti Aayog Rajiv Kumar visited China to hold bilateral talks with China's leading think-tank, the Development Research Center of the State Council. This followed a missive from Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale who asked functionaries to keep away from ‘Thank You India' events being organised by the Tibetan Government in exile. later on, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited India in March and then Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval too visited China. Much recently, the visit of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Ministerial summit and subsequently the visit of Defence Minister Nirmala Sitaraman to China are in the same direction. The meeting between the two Defence Ministers discussed the dates of bilateral military exercise ‘hand-in-hand' between the two countries that remained suspended given the standoff last year. In the given context and present situation of India-China relations, the question of setting the ‘reset button' must be understood with much pragmatism. While some identified the present efforts as ‘corrective measures' to dissuade Chinese concerns over India's strategic proximity to the US, some sensed a political rationale in it on the part of the Government to avoid any kind face-off in the coming months. In both cases, the present efforts make a ‘meaningful case' for India, which has for long attributed maintenance of ‘strategic autonomy' and ‘peaceful borderland' as its key foreign policy objective. It also needs to be seen how much these developments make up for resetting of mutual ties between India and China. For example, the shifting of venue from New Delhi to Dharamshala marking 60-year celebration of Dalai lama's arrival to India and the last minute presence of senior Cabinet Minister for the event shows the political limitations of this exercise. Moreover, on the border issue itself, the scale and quality of transgression by the Chinese has been a concern for India, including Depsang, Chumar, and Doklam. This happened when both the sides were having constant high-level visits; even when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping have met in last years. Certainly, it must also be accepted that despite differences on various issues, both countries have shown interest for cooperation in some sectors. China played a helping hand for India in grey-listing Pakistan at the Financial Action Task Force meeting on terror financing. Recently, China and India have initiated discussions to jointly use their leverage in oil price negotiations. In addition, both the countries are having cooperation in global climate change negotiations. Not necessarily every Chinese plan is to be understood as directed towards India, and is more likely to be driven by domestic, political and economic compulsions. Similarly, India's drive away from long-established ‘strategic reticence' is desired by its more aspirational role in global politics and not against China. Modi's recent visit to China for an ‘informal meeting' with Xi, much before the scheduled SCO summit in Qingdao in June, clearly spells out a clear signal that both countries are concerned about mutual ties. While much of these high-level visits are pre-planned and official, the Wuhan meeting reflects greater urgency and sense for engagement when other established mechanism have not been fruitful in bilateral relations. The two leaders in last 24 hours had six meetings in delegation level and one-to-one talks, discussing issues like trade, strategic military relations, tourism and other regional issues. As reported, both reiterated common threat of terrorism and likely cooperation in economic project on Afghanistan. Sailing in the same boat on the East lake in Wuhan, both leaders reiterated for peace, prosperity, and development. Impressively, Modi underscored the importance of people-to-people contact between India and China by coining the idea of ‘STRENGTH', which makes for spirituality; tradition, trade, and technology; relationship; entertainment; nature conservation; games; tourism and health. The key challenge before the ‘reset' exercise between both the leadership is that it should not be seen as an end in itself. As developments suggest no ‘joint statement' is likely to be expected after the Wuhan summit. The pre-emptive display of expectations would have made the analysis of summit in a ‘zero sum game' mode assessing respective gains. Rather, the summit largely focuses on broader agenda keeping in mind the scope for positive engagements and cooperation in future. Interestingly, the success of resetting mutual ties cannot be attributed to any specific step or objective. The rapprochement with China is no lesser in India's interest but has to be realised with the mutual understanding and similar responses.","The text discusses efforts to reset India-China relations amidst various challenges and differences. Despite issues like India's membership to the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the listing of Masood Azhar, recent high-level visits suggest a thaw in relations. These visits, including by Indian officials like Niti Aayog's Rajiv Kumar and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, aim to address concerns and enhance cooperation. However, challenges like border tensions and differing political agendas remain. The recent informal meeting between Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping in Wuhan signifies a mutual desire for engagement and cooperation. While the reset is crucial, its success depends on mutual understanding and ongoing positive engagement rather than specific outcomes.",International Relations / Diplomacy,2018-04-30 00:00:00

"Bombay HC quashes rape FIR against builder, imposes Rs 50,000 cost","MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has quashed a rape FIR registered against a builder who had approached the court saying it was a consensual relationship and the victim had filed the complaint due to ""some confusion"" and now they have amicably settled the matter. The division bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Prithviraj Chavan last week quashed the FIR lodged at NRI Coastal police station and directed the petitioner to deposit within three weeks, Rs 50,000 with Jeevan Sandhya Mangalya Sansthan as cost. The petitioner, who is a partner in a construction fi-rm, is married and has two so-ns. The victim, a former sales manager at his firm, is a divorcee with a five-year-old son. Police said the woman joined the firm in 2020 and got close to the builder. They started living together as he promised to divorce his wife and marry her. However, later he broke off the relationship and she lost her job. She said in January 2021, she re-established contact with the builder and he convinced her to get together again. When she got pregnant, he took her to a clinic in Seawoods and made her to undergo an abortion, she said. The woman said when she was unwell, she called him up, but his wife sent a text from his phone telling her not to contact him and blocked her number. She then filed a complaint and two months later, police filed a chargesheet in the rape case. Advocate Mahesh Vaswani, along with advocate Sheetal Patkar and Shreya Tiwari, led the arguments for the petitioner, while Dharini Nagda appeared for the complainant, who also gave her consent for quashing the FIR. ""Both parties have amicably settled the matter and have decided to quash the FIR. In the petition, the victim said she had lodged the complaint due to a misunderstanding and in the heat of the moment,"" said Vaswani. The victim told the court that the allegations in the FIR are purely of personal nature and she has no objection if the FIR and the chargesheet are quashed and set aside as they have amicably settled the dispute. The HC then quashed the FIR.","The Bombay High Court has quashed a rape FIR registered against a builder.

Advani dares Pak to fourth war,"Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani today dared Pakistan to fight a fourth direct war with India instead of engaging in proxy war, targeting temples and innocent civilians. Charging Islamabad with nursing a wound since the creation of Bangladesh, he threw an open challenge to Pakistan, saying “let us fight it out face to face. We have fought thrice, let there be a fourth war.” Kickstarting the BJP’s campaign for the Gujarat Assembly elections, Mr Advani said had Pakistan fought with the Indian security forces he would have had no reservations. “But killing of innocent civilians by attacking temples like Akshardham and Raghunath is unacceptable,” he said. Campaigning for Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, Mr Advani accused the Congress of “defaming” the Government and people of the state, projecting them as “killers and criminals”. Leading the BJP charge from the quake devastated town here, he defended Mr Modi’s performance in tackling the situation during the post-Godhra riots. He hit out at Congress chief ministerial aspirant Shankar-sinh Vaghela for “defaming” Gujarat, its people and the country during his trip to the USA. In a hard-hitting speech, Mr Advani said ever since the Godhra incident on February 27, “Gujaratis are being projected before the whole world as murderers and criminals”. Recalling that he had never attacked the government in power during his visits abroad as an Opposition leader for over 25 years, Mr Advani took strong exception to the recent outbursts against Mr Modi and the BJP by Mr Vaghela during his Washington visit. “How Gujarat has been projected abroad is very shameful. Baseless allegations were levelled against a popular Chief Minister like Mr Modi, who did a great job. But he has been projected as a great criminal. Gujarat has undergone several natural calamities but now they have to suffer humiliation at the hands of their own people,” he said. The Deputy Prime Minister praised the state police for its “efficient” role during the riots and recalled that it had saved 300 students of a madarsa in Bhavnagar from rioters and even Marxist leaders had thanked it for that. “But the whole police force was defamed and projected as ineffective and criminals,” Mr Advani said. Describing Mr Vaghela, a former BJP leader, as a “leftover” of the party, he said the poll would be a referendum on the people of Gujarat rather than a battle between the Congress and the BJP”.","Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani challenged Pakistan to a direct war instead of engaging in proxy conflicts, condemning attacks on temples and civilians. He defended Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's handling of post-Godhra riots and criticized Congress for defaming Gujarat and its people.

MCX market share jumps to 86%,"In the first fortnight after Financial Technologies (India) offloaded its entire shareholding in the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX), the market share of the country’s largest commodity bourse surged to 86.3% during the October1-16 period, the highest since July last year, showed latest company data. In December last year, commodity markers regulator FMC had declared promoter Jignesh Shah and FTIL “not fit and proper” in connection with a R5,600-crore settlement scam at the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FTIL. Later, even stock market regulator Sebi declared both Shah and FTIL unfit. According to regulatory norms, any person declared unfit can’t hold shares in any of the exchanges, so FTIL was required to sell its 26% stake in MCX. The market share of MCX started falling at a fast pace after October last year, as the settlement crisis at group firm NSEL on top of a 0.01% transaction tax on non-farm futures hit trading. While MCX had grabbed a market share of 86% during the July-September quarter last year, its dominance declined and the market share dropped to 78.4% in the second half of the last fiscal. However, MCX?s market share has held steady at above 80% starting April 2014, mainly as regulators and other government agencies stepped in to calm fears in the market. FMC will release the fortnightly turnover data for all exchanges later this month. FTIL said on September 29 that it completed the sale of its last tranche of shares ? totalling 15% ? in MCX to Kotak Mahindra Bank for R459 crore, marking its departure from the bourse after weeks of uncertainty surrounding the sale. FMC had threatened MCX that it wouldn’t allow launches of contracts if FTIL didn’t exit the bourse. Analysts have also blamed the commodity transaction tax for the drop in MCX’s turnover. Following imposition of the tax on the seller in July last year, costs of trading on the MCX platform rose to R6.60 from R1.60 on a transaction value of R1,00,000. Similarly, costs on other national-level exchanges also trebled in July last year from the previous month?s level, which hurt turnover as some investors shifted to the stock market. On July 31 last year, NSEL was forced to suspend one-day forward contracts and defer settlements after the government said the exchange was violating rules by allowing contracts of tenures longer than 11 days. On August 6, the exchange stopped its e-series contracts, marking the end of trading on its platform for the time being.","After Financial Technologies (India) divested its entire shareholding in the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX), the market share of MCX surged to 86.3% in the first fortnight of October, the highest since July last year, according to latest company data.

"Warner, Pucovski return for 3rd Test, Burns out","Australia on Wednesday brought back David Warner and Will Pucovski to bolster their under-fire batting line-up for the remainder of the Test series against India and dropped struggling opener Joe Burns. Burns just has a half-century to show in his four innings and has been struggling for form for some time now. He has managed scores of 8, 51 not out, 0 and 4 in Adelaide and Melbourne. The series is locked 1-1 after India won the second Test in Melbourne on Monday. With Warner, who missed out a major chunk of the India assignment due to a groin injury, looking fit for the job, dropping Burns was an easy decision to make. “Joe Burns has been released from the squad and will return to the Brisbane Heat. Unfortunately, Joe's returns haven’t been what he or the selectors would like or what we consider he is capable of,” National selector Trevor Hohns said in a statement. “David Warner, Will Pucovski and Sean Abbott will rejoin the squad in Melbourne tomorrow evening in preparation for the Sydney Test,” he added. Hohns said Warner would be given every chance to be back in the XI for the third Test starting January 7 in Sydney. “David has made strong progress in his recovery from injury and will be given every chance to play in Sydney with another seven days until the match. Sean has fully recovered from a calf strain and is also available for selection.” Talking about Pucovski, who suffered a concussion during a practice game, Hohns said,""Will is in the final stages of the graduated return to play protocols and has been symptom free for some time. He will be fit to play in Sydney subject to completing the return to play protocols and an independent assessment.""","David Warner, Will Pucovski and Sean Abbott will return for the third Test against India.

Depicts Ashokan empire': India downplays new Parliament building mural amid concerns in Nepal,"NEW DELHI: India on Friday downplayed the issue of a mural in the new Parliament building that has triggered some concerns in Nepal and Pakistan. At a media briefing, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi described the mural as an artwork that depicted the spread of the prehistoric Ashokan empire. ""The mural in question depicts the spread of the Ashokan empire and the idea of responsible and people-oriented governance that he (Ashoka) adopted and propagated,"" Bagchi said, replying to a question on the issue. ""That's what the plaque in front of the mural says. I really don't have anything further to add to that. I am certainly not going to comment on statements that other political leaders might have made,"" he said.

Several political leaders in Nepal reacted strongly to the mural and some of them even asked Nepalese Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' to raise the issue with New Delhi. The Nepalese prime minister is currently on a visit to India. Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said on Thursday that the mural issue was not raised by the Nepalese prime minister during his talks with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi. Bagchi said he was not aware whether protests were going on in Nepal over the matter.

Why has the State of Texas sued Meta?,"""February 26, 2022 08:00 pm | Updated 08:00 pm IST The story so far: The U.S. State of Texas has sued Meta for using biometric data of users for commercial purposes without their informed consent. Meta, formerly known as Facebook, is the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. “The scope of Facebook's misconduct is staggering,” the lawsuit said, targeting the social media giant under various Texas laws. What are the allegations made in the lawsuit? The lawsuit was filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The document alleges that Facebook captured biometric information of the residents of Texas from their photos and videos uploaded on the website for over ten years and disclosed it to third-party applications for commercial benefits. It also adds that Facebook did not destroy this data “within a reasonable time”. “Facebook’s omnipresent empire was built on deception, lies, and brazen abuses of Texan’s privacy rights – all for Facebook’s own commercial gain. Of relevance here, for over a decade, while holding itself out as a trusted meeting place for Texans to connect and share special moments with family and friends, Facebook was secretly capturing, disclosing, unlawfully retaining – and profiting off of – Texans' most personal and highly sensitive information: records of their facial geometries,” the lawsuit document reads. Facebook was reportedly capturing data of non-users as well, from photos and videos uploaded on the website by their acquaintances. The lawsuit further alleges that by capturing sensitive biometric information, Facebook improved its facial-recognition technology and created a powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that has now spread around the globe. Meta’s alleged actions violate Texas’ Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act (CUBI) and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). CUBI defines retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or record of hand or face geometry as “biometric identifiers”. The law prohibits the use of these identifiers for commercial purposes unless the individual was informed before the information was captured and explicit consent to record the identifier was received. It also calls for biometric identifiers to be destroyed within a reasonable time. DTPA deems “false, misleading, or deceptive acts or practices” in business as unlawful in Texas. The lawsuit also accuses Meta of running similar experiments on its image-sharing platform Instagram, although Instagram’s data policy mentions that users will be notified if facial recognition is introduced on the site. What is facial recognition technology? Facial recognition technology uses sophisticated algorithms to record features like face geometry and retina and iris scans to develop an electronic map of the face, thus making it easier to reveal the identities of people through photographs and videos. Read: How is facial recognition used in today’s world? While this technology has become extensively intertwined with our lives in how we unlock our mobile phones, how we gain access to our bank accounts and so on, facial recognition can also be used as a tool of surveillance. China reportedly uses facial recognition technology in Xinjiang province. The Texas lawsuit against Meta points out that the technology can be misused by stalkers and criminals to reveal information about their targets, including their exact geographical locations. Has Facebook discontinued facial recognition? In November 2021, Facebook had announced that it will shut down its facial-recognition system that identifies people in photos and videos uploaded on the social media site. The company also said that it will delete the faceprints of over one billion people. “This change will represent one of the largest shifts in facial recognition usage in the technology’s history,” Jerome Pesenti, vice president of artificial intelligence at Meta, had said. Previously in September 2019, Facebook had announced that it was discontinuing the tag suggestions setting under which the website itself could suggest its users to tag other people in photos and videos using facial recognition. The Texas lawsuit alleges that Facebook was capturing facial geometry to train its AI under the garb of improving user experience. In 2015, Facebook was sued in Illinois, U.S., under the Biometric Information Privacy Act. The class-action lawsuit alleged that the social media platform did not adequately disclose how it handled the biometric data of users. Facebook finally settled the dispute in February 2021 and agreed to pay $650 million to the 1.6 million members of the class in Illinois.""","The lawsuit was filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.

Can't drive away with a driving licence anymore!,"Obtaining a driving licence will no longer be a child’s play in the coming days. A draft plan prepared by the Union transport ministry proposes that anyone who wishes to obtain a driving licence must provide full details about the institute from which he/she has learnt driving. The draft says anyone seeking a licence should not only give details of the date and enrolment number with the driving school, but also information about the training period, certificate number and date of issuance of driving school certificate to the motor licensing officer. It is learnt that the draft was readied in the wake of the ""Accidents in India 2017"" report by the police, suggesting that drivers’ fault was the single biggest factor responsible for 84 per cent of accidents, 80.3 per cent of deaths and to 83.9 per cent of injuries. Earlier, the transport ministry had also linked driving licences to Aadhaar to check fake and multiple licences being issued across the country. Linking driving licences with the 12-digit unique number will help regional transport officials identify a driver or a rider easily. The ministry has also decided that candidates must undergo a two-day training session for renewal of old driving licences. A transport sector expert said, ""Those who have not learnt driving from training schools but do know how to drive will have to fill out ‘Form 5’ to get a training certificate from the authority.""","The Union transport ministry is proposing changes to the process of obtaining a driving license in India. According to a draft plan, individuals applying for a license will need to provide detailed information about the driving school or institute from which they learned to drive. This includes the date, enrollment number, training period, certificate number, and date of issuance of the driving school certificate. The move is aimed at improving road safety, considering that a significant percentage of accidents in India are attributed to drivers' faults.

Govt earmarks Rs 1.5k cr for solar projects over next 2 yrs,"NEW DELHI: The government would dole out Rs 1,500 crore over the next two years to banks and finance companies to lend money to solar energy projects at a generous 5% interest rate, a top government official said. The money would be lent to small solar projects adding up to 200 mw by companies like Sidbi, Nabard and National Housing Bank. These lenders would be provided interest-free loans by the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), an arm of the renewable energy ministry. The agency would also provide funds to state-run banks in urban areas at 2% interest rate.This would allow conservative bankers to lend more to renewable sectors, said Debashish Majumdar, chairman and managing director of IREDA, a non-banking financial institution that provides term loans for renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects. The projects are coming up under Phase 1 of the national solar mission. The mission aims to add 20,000 mw of solar power by 2022.IREDA is likely to achieve a net profit of Rs 100 crore in the current financial year against Rs 73 crore in the last fiscal.The loans sanctioned by the agency have increased from Rs 1,823 crore in 2009-10 to about Rs 2,300 crore this year. With disbursements growing at a robust 30%, the agency is likely to achieve Rs 1,150 crore in the current fiscal as against Rs 889 crore in the last fiscal.Recently, it signed a Rs 1,200-crore agreement with Germany’s Kfw Bank and it would sign a deal with Japan International Co-operation Agency by the end of March for Rs 1,650 crore.","The Indian government plans to disburse Rs 1,500 crore over the next two years to banks and finance companies, enabling them to provide low-interest loans to solar energy projects at a favorable 5% interest rate.

8-point initiative for Kashmir,"The Cabinet Committee of Security (CCS) rolled out an eight-point agenda to deal with raging issues in the strife-torn Jammu and Kashmir. The agenda has a humane face and aims at tackling aspects that have rankled the Kashmiri psyche, especially after the spate of deaths in protest and curfew related incidents in the past few months. The CCS chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cleared the bold initiative that sends out a clear signal that the government was ready for talks to solve matters while not forgetting the sentiments of the Hindu-dominated Jammu region as also the militarily important Ladakh region. The agenda is aimed at youth. It even hints at a method by which the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) — a major sore point with the Kashmiris — could be withdrawn from some areas of the state. The Union Home, Minister P Chidambaram, announced the agenda this evening. It says the government will appoint a group of interlocutors under the chairmanship of an eminent person to begin the process of a “sustained dialogue” with all sections of the people of J&K, including political parties, groups, youth and student organisations, civil society organisations and other stakeholders. The CCS decided to “request to the state government to review the notification declaring areas as disturbed areas”. This means, in case the government decides to rescind the notification of “disturbed areas” from some key cities, the AFSPA will automatically not apply to those cities. Sources said the state’s summer capital of Srinagar could be one such city to start with. In Manipur, the AFSPA has been lifted from the capital city and this was one of the suggestions that emerged from the recent visit of the all-party delegation to Kashmir. The major grouse of the Kashmiris of “militarisation” will be addressed. A meeting of the Unified Command of forces will be convened immediately to review the deployment of security forces in the Valley, especially Srinagar, with particular reference to de-scaling the number of bunkers and check-points in the city. The CCS also “advised” the state government to review the cases of all detenues under the Public Safety Act, 1978. The PSA is a strict law that enables the police to arrest a person and keep him in jail without any trial for a year. The CCS also decide to “advice” the state government to immediately release all students and youth detained for stone pelting or similar violations of law. The government okayed an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh per person killed in the civil disturbances since June 11 this year. The CCS appointed two special task forces, one each for Jammu and Ladakh, to examine the developmental needs of the two regions, with particular reference to deficiencies in infrastructure. The state government has been asked to reopen all schools, colleges and universities. It has also been advised to hold special classes/lectures, if necessary, and to ensure that the examinations for the current academic year (2010-11) are conducted. The union government will provide a sum of Rs 100 crore as additional Central assistance (ACA) in order to make grants to schools and colleges ”for improvements and additions to the existing infrastructure”.","The Centre unveiled an eight-point plan to address unrest in Jammu and Kashmir, focusing on dialogue, de-escalation, and youth outreach. Key steps include reviewing AFSPA areas, releasing detained students, compensating victims’ families, reducing security presence, and supporting education. Special task forces will address development needs in Jammu and Ladakh.",National News,2010-09-26 00:00:00
My life not as important as yours': Dallewal tells farmers at Khanauri Mahapanchayat,"CHANDIGARH: Addressing the Kisan Mahapanchayat at the Khanauri border (Punjab-Haryana border), farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal on Saturday said that he is more concerned about the lives of his fellow farmers who are ""reeling under distress"" due to the challenges in the sector. ""My life is not as important as the lives of lakhs of Indian farmers, who are reeling under distress. Already over seven lakh farmers have died by suicide owing to the distress in the farming sector,"" Dallewal said. Addressing a massive gathering of farmers, Dallewal on the 40th day of his fast-unto-death, urged them to ensure representation from every village at the Khanauri border, where farmers under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha, have been camping at since February 13 last year, after their march to Delhi was stopped by Haryana Police. Speaking of his fast, a fragile Dallewal said that the police made several attempts to take him to the hospital, but they were foiled by the volunteers. Thanking the protesting farmers for their steadfast support, Dallewal urged them to remain united in the struggle. The 70-year old leader's words resonated with the audience, drawing loud cheers and renewed pledges of commitment to the movement. There was a massive turn up of crowd at the Mahapanchayat to listen to Dallewal as hours before he underwent an ECG test and his report was stated to be normal. He thanked the people for turning up in large numbers. Meanwhile, doctors attending Dallewal advised that he should not speak much as it could deteriorate his health. According to sources, bringing him on the stage amid the cold wave was a challenge as his blood pressure was fluctuating. A makeshift cubical was built on the stage from where Dallewal addressed the gathering. The venue of the mahapanchayat was spread over a four-kilometer stretch along the highway in Khanauri, which is otherwise known as truck scrap yard of Punjab which was transformed into a bustling tent city. With a Supreme Court order directing the Punjab government to hospitalise Dallewal immediately, the farmers, in a stunning show of solidarity, fortified the area at Khanauri with over 100 trailers parked next to each other and some even welded together. farmers Protesting farmers gather at the Khanuari border during Kisan Mahapanchayat.

The three deceased women were identified as Sarbjit Kaur (55), Balbir Kaur (67) and Jabir Kaur, all residents of Kotha Guru village in Bathinda. The injured were rushed to Civil Hospital at Barnala, for treatment, from where about a dozen injured persons were discharged after giving treatment. More than 50 farmers were travelling on the bus. In another accident, five activists of BKU (Sidhupur) were injuried when their bus met with an accident near Barnala as farmers were going from Dallewala village to Khanauri to participate in the Kisan Mahapanchayat. Farmer leader Kaka Singh Kotda said that a parallel protest at Tohana in Haryana by the SKM would have no impact on their protest. After attending the kisan maha panchayat in Tohana, BKU national spokesperson Rakesh Tikai said that the next farmers' agitation will be on the KMP Expressway to block Delhi as a broad outline on this has been prepared for that. Besides a legally guaranteed MSP, the farmers have been demanding a farm loan waiver, pension for farmers and farm labourers, no hike in the electricity tariff, withdrawal of police cases and justice for the victims of the 2021 Lakhimpur Kheri violence, reinstatement of the Land Acquisition Act, 2013 and compensation to the families of the farmers who died during a previous agitation in 2020-21.","Here's a summary of the article: At the Kisan Mahapanchayat held at the Khanauri border, Punjab-Haryana, farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal addressed a large gathering on the 40th day of his fast-unto-death, emphasizing the distress faced by farmers in India.

"Forced shut by pandemic, five Himachal temples donate Rs 9 cr in Covid relief fund","Novel coronavirus forced them shut during Navratras, but five major temples in Himachal Pradesh, which is known as Devbhoomi, have contributed more than Rs 9.21 crore towards the state Covid-19 relief fund. Interestingly, these temples got a little over Rs 4.21 lakh in online donation during the Navratras. Three of these temples are situated in Kangra district: Jwalamukhi Temple, Chamunda Temple and Brijeshwari Temple, also known as Kangra Temple. Among the remaining two, one is in Una district - Chintpurni Temple - and the other - Naina Devi Temple - is in Bilaspur district. These temples are run by government trusts headed by respective Deputy Commissioners. Kangra is a curious case. While elsewhere online donations went up as compared to last year, the reverse happened in this district. During last year's Chaitra Navratras, which usually fall in March-April, the Chamunda Temple had got Rs 3,19,453 while it got only Rs 50,255 this year. The Kangra Temple had received Rs 4,46,549 last year. But this year it got only Rs 92,439. So is the case with the Jwalamukhi Temple. Last year, it had got Rs 11,72,993, the highest among the five temples in online offerings, but could get only Rs 1,18,494 this year. Kangra Deputy Commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati says, ""We were expecting online donations to go up. But they came down."" While the Jwalamukhi Temple contributed Rs 1 crore towards the Covid relief fund, Brijeshwari Temple contributed Rs 50 lakh. DC Prajapati claims they are planning to contribute Rs 21 lakh from the Chamunda Temple as well. The Chintpurni Temple has the distinction of making the maximum contribution and getting the minimum online donation. Last year, it had got only Rs 1,323.65 in online offerings. The amount went up to Rs 4,188.45 this year. The temple, however, made a contribution of Rs 5 crore to the state Covid relief fund. Una Deputy Commissioner Sandeep Kumar says, ""The online donation is insignificant. The concept is yet to pick up here."" The Naina Devi Temple is not an extreme case. It occupies the middle-of-the-road space. It had got Rs 1,53,103 in online offerings last year. The amount went up to Rs 1,55,700 this year. It donated Rs 2.5 crore to the relief fund. Besides, the aarati in the temples was webcast during the Navratras this year. While the Jwalamukhi Temple recorded more than 50,000 views every day, the Chamunda and Kangra temples registered around 20,000 views. The Chintpurni Temple got around 55,000 views every day. No webcasting arrangement was made last year. The Naina Devi Temple did not go in for webcasting of aarati. Bilaspur Deputy Commissioner Rajeshwar Goel says, ""We have a tie-up with Tata Sky. They have been telecasting our aarati for the last four years.""","Interestingly, these temples got a little over Rs 4.21 lakh in online donation during the Navratras.",Society/Religion.,2020-08-01 00:00:00

Govt initiates action as employees go on strike,"Thousands of state government employees openly defied the state government’s warning by participating in the first phase of the pen- and tool-down strike launched by the Confederation of Service Associations of Arunachal Pradesh (CoSAAP) on Thursday, crippling normal office business. The state government had on Wednesday warned of serious disciplinary action against employees taking part in the strike. Employees of several major departments abstained from their duties and the state government now finds itself at loggerheads with the CoSAAP. “I have come to office and will be sitting the whole day here, but I will not be working,” said a junior officer at the civil secretariat. The agitation has reportedly crippled usual governmental functions as thousands of employees across the state joined the strike. Employees at the civil secretariat sat around leisurely without working, and many of the office chambers, including the finance department and the budget section, were either deserted or were occupied by agitating employees. “We are on agitation, so no one is working today,” said an employee who preferred not to be named. The CoSAAP has been demanding the implementation of the 7th CPC allowances in toto, along with other service benefits for the employees, “on the strength of the provisions contained in the Statehood Act, 1986, and further Adaptation of Laws Orders of 1989.” When contacted by The Arunachal Times, Home Commissioner Ashish Chandra Verma, who is the chief secretary in-charge, contradicted the media reports, stating that most departments were “functioning normally,” and that there was “minimal effect” (of the strike).“Some of the employees were reported to be on agitation. The lists of such employees have been obtained, and proceedings to deduct one day salary has been initiated as per the principle of ‘no work, no pay’,” he said. Later, in a press statement, the CS’ office extended gratitude to “the majority of employees who chose to work in public interest in spite of inducement and threats by certain persons.” It said if any government employee is found to be participating in the agitation on 12 October, “dies non along with ‘break in service’ will be initiated against the participating employee.” Verma inspected various offices on Thursday, and said mobile teams would be constituted to check the situation in the offices on Friday also. The CS in-charge also urged the employees to “refrain from any illegal action which may adversely affect public interest.” The government has already issued an order (No PERS-113/2018/202, dated 10 October) declaring the strike illegal, and warning the striking employees of action in case they resort to pen- or tool-down strike. CoSAAP claims success Meanwhile, the CoSAAP issued a press statement saying that the first day of its “non-cooperation democratic movement” passed off successfully. Claiming “100% support” from the state government employees, the confederation advised the government against being “adamant” in not considering its demands.","A pen- and tool-down strike, organized by the Confederation of Service Associations of Arunachal Pradesh (CoSAAP), in the first phase of their non-cooperation democratic movement saw thousands of state government employees participating, despite the state government's warning of disciplinary action for taking part.

Employees of major departments abstained from their duties, with some in the civil secretariat refusing to work, leading to a partial shutdown of governmental functions. The state government disputes the extent of the strike's impact, with the chief secretary in-charge, Home Commissioner Ashish Chandra Verma, stating that most departments were ""functioning normally.""

Jindal Power asks NHPC to take over Arunachal hydro projects or form joint venture,"Jindal Steel & Power Ltd (JSPL) has approached NHPC asking it to either take over its 5,397 MW hydro power projects worth about Rs 37,779 crore or form joint ventures. Jindal Power approached NHPC for its three projects in Arunachal Pradesh - 1,800 MW Kamala HEP (earlier known as Subansiri Middle project), 3097 MW Etalin Hydroelectric Project (HEP) and 500 MW Attunli Hydroelectric Project. ""A representative from Jindal (Power) approached us and they offered Subansiri Middle, Etalin and Attunli either to take over or in joint venture. They approached us either in December or in January,"" NHPC Chairman and Managing Director K M Singh said in an exclusive interview to PTI. While Etalin Project is being executed through the Etalin Hydro Electric Power Co Ltd, a Joint Venture of Jindal Power and Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh, Kamala Project is executed by Kamala Hydro Electric Power Co Ltd, in which Jindal Power holds 74 per cent and the Arunachal Pradesh government undertaking holds 26 per cent. ""We are ready to take over but the question is cost. If the project's cost as on date is viable then certainly NHPC is ready to take over either on ownership basis or in joint venture with NHPC having the major stakeholding,"" Singh said. Attunli Hydroelectric Project is being executed through Attunli Hydro Electric Power Co Ltd, a JV of Jindal Power (74 per cent) and Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Ltd (26 per cent). Jindal Power spokesperson said, ""JSPL is currently in the black out period preceding the declaration of the third quarter results and therefore will not be able to comment on any financials."" Jindal Power (JPL) had signed agreements for development of three hydroelectric projects with a combined capacity of 6100 MW in Arunachal Pradesh in joint venture with Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited (HPDCAPL).

"Dismantle terrorist units, Putin asks Pak India, Russia sign 8 agreements","The top Indian leadership’s talks with the visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin resulted in a significant progress on wide-ranging issues, including two of immense strategic importance: the India-Russia-China axis and the two countries’ political will to close ranks in fighting the scourge of terrorism. During the day-long talks Mr Putin had with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha and a host of other leaders, the two countries agreed to enhance intelligence-sharing on Al-Qaida and Taliban cadres and a greater military-to-military cooperation, well-placed sources in the Vajpayee government told ‘The Tribune’ tonight. The two countries today signed eight agreements, significantly none on defence deals. The Delhi Declaration lays stress on further consolidation of strategic partnership. A Joint Declaration was inked on strengthening and enhancing economic, scientific and technological cooperation. The two also issued a Joint Statement stressing the importance of “Islamabad implementing in full its obligations and promises to prevent the infiltration of terrorists across the Line of Control into Jammu and Kashmir and at other points across the border as well as to eliminate terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled territory as a prerequisite for the renewal of the peaceful dialogue” between New Delhi and Islamabad. Later in the evening, Mr Putin minced no words when in his joint press conference with Mr Vajpayee, he backed India’s stand advised Pakistan to not only put a stop to the infiltration of terrorists into India but also “liquidate its entire terrorism infrastructure.” Both Mr Putin and Mr Vajpayee said the Indo-Russian relations by now were reaching “newer targets”, had transcended a buyer-seller relationship and acquired strategic overtones. On the sensitive question of the much-hyped India-Russia-China axis, a senior official remarked, “The progress on this issue was satisfactory and significant ground was achieved. On such issues, ground is made millimetre by millimetre, not mile by mile.” Mr Vajpayee, in his opening remarks at the joint press interaction, said both India and Russia strongly opposed terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and pledged to work bilaterally and through international fora to combat the menace. He favoured evolving strong defence mechanisms in tackling terrorism in a coordinated manner. “The fight against terrorism must not admit of any double standards and should also target the financial and other sources of support to terrorism”, the two countries said in a joint statement, while referring to Pakistan’s continued and open support to cross border terrorism.","Indian and Russian leaders, including Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and President Vladimir Putin, made significant progress on crucial issues during Putin's visit.

"India asks IMF to review loans to Pakistan, Indian govt source says","India Asks IMF to Review Loans to Pakistan: Key Points 1. India’s Request to IMF Formal Appeal: India has urged the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reassess its financial assistance to Pakistan. Reason: Concerns over Pakistan’s misuse of funds for debt repayment rather than economic reforms. 2. Background of IMF-Pakistan Deal Current Program: Pakistan is under a $3 billion IMF bailout (2023) to avoid default. India’s Stance: Argues that IMF loans indirectly support Pakistan’s military & adversarial policies against India. 3. Key Indian Concerns Debt Sustainability: Pakistan’s external debt exceeds $125B, raising default risks. Geopolitical Tensions: Funds could free up Pakistan’s budget for defense spending vs. India. Transparency Demand: India seeks stricter IMF monitoring of Pakistan’s fund utilization. 4. IMF’s Likely Response Review Unlikely: IMF typically follows economic criteria, not geopolitical factors. Possible Compromise: May impose tighter conditions on future tranches. 5. Broader Implications Diplomatic Friction: India-Pakistan tensions spill into multilateral financial forums. Global Precedent: Could influence how IMF treats conflict-zone bailouts.","India’s move signals a strategy to hold Pakistan accountable through financial scrutiny. While IMF may not alter existing loans, it could: ✅ Increase oversight on future disbursements. ⚠️ Strain India-Pakistan relations further. What’s Next?

When the game stands tall,"Films on sports and sportsmen in Indian mainstream cinema were few in the past. Lagaan (2001) created fictional history. But that was team sport – cricket. Nagesh Kukkunoor’s Iqbal (2005) was more about a hearing disabled boy’s struggle to find his feet in cricket. Today, Bollywood is flush with biopics on great sportsmen and womenBy Shoma A Chatterji When films are made on team sports such as Lagaan or even before that Awwal Number (1990 film by Dev Anand), the audience is aware that the films are pure fiction and entertainment is the driving force. The actors too, need lesser training and discipline than when they are bringing real sportspersons to life. When it comes to real-life realisations on celluloid such as Chak De India and Mary Kom, the picture changes. Actors prepared to make the creative and performing leap must be committed to the hard work involved in bringing to life the struggles, successes and failures of a famous sportsperson with his/her weaknesses and strengths. For the audience, these films are a motivational force with positive messages and lessons in patience, determination and focus being part of the story. How do the actors slipping under the skin of real characters, who have excelled in sport, perform with enough authenticity to convince the audience and the sportsperson, if alive? Take the example of the film on Paan Singh Tomar, an exceptional athlete, who ruled the steeplechase event (a 3,000-metre obstacle race that includes a water jump) at the National Games seven years in a row (his record stood unbeaten for 10 years) in the 1950s and 1960s, and represented India at international competitions. Later, he was forced to become a dacoit. Says actor Irrfan Khan who essayed the role of Tomar: “I heard about Tomar and his extra-ordinary achievements first from Tigmangshu Dhulia. Two months before the shoot, I took physical training from a Delhi-based national-level coach on Steeplechase. It was difficult but enjoyable. I also undertook lessons on voice modulation and pronunciation as I had to speak in local dialect.” “It was a different experience because you need to be convincing in all aspects to resemble the person that you are essaying. The character required me to be physically fit. Hence after the shoot, I would exercise. Chambal is a beautiful place, so I would go for jogs in the evenings”, Khan says. His hard work bagged him the Best Actor Award at the National Awards. He adds that the film has changed his way of looking at life, discipline and commitment. Let us see what Farhaan Akhtar had in for the title role in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag that fetched him the National Award for Best Actor. Olympian Milkha Singh is one of India’s most iconic athletes. The film is based on his life which has all cinematic elements of drama, irony, tragedy, struggles and triumphs. Farhaan transformed his look completely and turned himself into a man with lean body muscle. He went through hardcore training for 18 months before shooting began to acquire the original body Milkha Singh had as a young man. “But that had only 40 per cent of what we were working at. The remaining 60 per cent came from proper sleep and a clean diet because I was repeatedly told that our muscles need time to recover and need at least eight hours of sleep”, says Farhaan. He went into hard training, cardio exercises and a strict schedule. “Naturally, some of this tends to spill over into your real life even after the film is over, because the main goal was to increase the endurance”, he sums up. As this story is being written, news filters in that Mary Kom, selected for the Stockholm International Film Festival (SIFFJ), has won the Best Film Award and has been invested with the Bronze Horse Award, the festival’s top honour. Mary Kom will be showcased in Sweden again by the Indian Embassy at the Indian Film Festival next month. The jury for the junior section of the festival consisted of children from the age of nine to 17. Mary Kom is an Indian boxer of present day and an Olympic medal winner. She is a five-time World Amateur Boxing champion, and the only woman boxer to have won a medal in each one of the six world championships. She is the only Indian woman boxer to have qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics, competing in the flyweight (51 kg) category and winning the bronze medal. She became the first Indian woman boxer to get a Gold Medal in the Asian Games in 2014 in Incheon, South Korea. Priyanka Chopra was chosen to play Mary Kom in the film. Priyanka Chopra has repeatedly said Mary Kom has been one of the hardest films of her career. “I had to really sweat it out in the gym to achieve the perfect physique to portray the boxer on screen. I had to transform myself from a glamorous actress to a hard-hitting sportsperson. It took me two years of determination taught by my mentor Mary Kom herself.” Priyanka suffered an injury while shooting for the film while filming a boxing scene with an actor from the North-East. She fell on the floor because of the impact. But as she got the shot spot on, director Omung Kumar decided to retain it. “The cut mark one sees on the screen under her eye is real though it was touched up with a bit of make-up to make it seem more real”, says the director. Films on celebrated and classic sportspersons have created a new genre of biopics which are always very positive, strong and optimistic. One wonders what stance the director will take for the proposed biopic on Mohammed Azharuddin with Emran Hashmi playing Azharuddin considering the dark clouds looming over his off-the-field career. One needs to look at Sushant Singh Rajput’s realisation of M S Dhoni because Dhoni it is presumed, still has a lot left in him to give to Indian cricket, never mind that he has retired from Test cricket. There is Ranbir Kapoor penciled in for a biopic on Dhyan Chand. Will Abhishek Bacchan be able to pull off a Yuvraj Singh? Let us wait and see… (TWF)","When it comes to real-life realisations on celluloid such as Chak De India and Mary Kom, the picture changes.

The minimum support prices are announced by the Government at the beginning of the sowing season for certain crops, on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).n the ongoing protest by the farmers’ unions, the farmers have been demanding that the government grant MSP legal status & make it mandatory for the corporates. They fear that permitting trade of agricultural produce beyond the limits of APMCs would lead to exploitation of farmers by the corporates. They also allege that, through the enactment of the three farm laws, the government intends to do away with APMCs & the MSP, although the Prime Minister and the Agriculture Minister have tried to assure the farmers time & again that, it doesn’t have any such intention. It is obvious, the country has persisted with wrong agricultural policies for too long, leading to a totally distorted market, where no one, except few middlemen prosper. However, making MSP a legal right. and criminalization of commercial transactions will be a regressive step, completely diluting the proposed laws. It is not wrong for an average farmer to demand a better price for his produce. However, the legal backing of MSP or codifying the structure of MSP into law regulating thereby the prices of agricultural produce in the country, would cause a devastating blow to the farm sector in the country, it is opined. A simple economic analysis of such a measure, prohibiting purchase of agriculture produce below MSP, and criminalization of such an act, could leave millions of farmers without any avenue to sell, and possibly divert tax payers’ money to benefit the traders and corporations, it is opined. A fundamental rule of economics, according to opponents is, when any price floors are set, which is what MSP is going to be, then there is bound to be surplus production. This is what has been happening in the country every year, with excess wheat and rice being produced, as the most effective procurement on MSP happens for these crops, and cropping decisions are influenced by the price certainty, offered by such guaranteed prices. However, given the fiscal and logistical constraints, only a small fraction of the produce is purchased, that benefits only few farmers, approximately 6%, primarily concentrated in Punjab and Haryana. If the government has to buy all the crops, then there will be difficulties regarding its storage, it is pointed out. Also, in making the MSP mandatory, there will also be difficulties regarding the quality of the crop, because the government has to decide which quality will be procured at MSP, and what will be the rate for the poor quality, and who will buy it.","The ongoing farmers' protest in India revolves around demands to grant legal status to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and make it mandatory for corporates. Farmers fear exploitation if agricultural trade extends beyond Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). While the country's agricultural policies have favored middlemen, making MSP legally binding and criminalizing transactions below it could lead to surplus production, logistical challenges, and potential taxpayer burden. Balancing farmers' needs and economic realities is crucial for effective agricultural reforms without causing unintended consequences.",Economy,2021-09-23 00:00:00
"ICC World Twenty20 2016: Minus Chris Gayle, force still with West Indies","Written bySriram VeeraBangalore |Updated: March 21, 2016 11:23 IST6 min readPRINTAndre Fletcher scored a 64-ball-84 to anchor the chase for West Indies. (Source: PTI)It was a meandering kind of a game where nothing much really happened once Tillekaratne Dilshan and Dinesh Chandimal fell early, and Sri Lanka dawdled to a below-par score on a sluggish pitch that aided a bit of turn.Andre Fletcher came up with a real good knock against three Sri Lankan spinners, and took his team home with nearly two overs to spare. But there were two take-away moments from the game. The first had deceit, skill, trickery from Dwayne Bravo – a devilish slower ball that dipped so rapidly on an advancing Angelo Mathews who was so bewildered that he thought it was a beamer and ducked. The second was an awww moment: the crowd yelling, “We want Gayle, We want Gayle” on a loop from the first ball of the chase but we shall come to that later.Lasith Malinga has a killer of a slower one that also dips alarmingly late but with his side-arm sling action, it’s a tad easier. Easy isn’t probably the right qualifying word for such a delicate and difficult art but hope you get the idea. For someone with high-arm action, the dip that Bravo gets is quite thrilling.Mathews hadn’t done himself any favours by his charge down the track – a position from where the slower one could easily be confused as a beamer. And so he began to duck. But this is where Bravo’s bag of tricks came through. He had released the ball, held between his thumb and fore-finger, and the tweak he gives just before he let it go had the ball dip. A startled Mathews had his bat up as a face shield, probably, and the ball fell down rapidly, bounded off the edge of the bat and popped up to the keeper.Story continues below this adThe Indian readers might remember the Bravo delivery from 2006 that had Ajit Agarkar in a trance – the ball had looped up before it was sucked down really quickly and a bemused Agarkar could only see it go past him and tip the middle stump. The Sri Lankans might have remembered Aravinda de Silva fooled by Australia’s Craig McDermott in the 90’s. McDermott chose the split-fingers technique and he had honed his skills well enough to have the ability to slide the fingers out, away from the seam at the last instant.Aravinda saw the ball was around waist high when he suddenly lost sight of it as the ball started to fall down sharply. A surprised de Silva couldn’t quite adjust and was trapped in front. The neutrals might have recalled Chris Cairns fooling England’s Chris Read in a Test match at Lord’s. Read too had ducked, like Mathews, and the ball ended up yorking him but as good the ball was from Cairns, Read’s decision to go down under was because due to sightscreen issues that meant he didn’t see the ball at all.Awww momentNow to the awww moment(s) of the day. Around the time Mathews was ducking into the slower one,Chris Gaylehad a twitch on his left hamstring, and he went back to the dugout to rest. He couldn’t come out to bat in the chase as the rule dictates that he had to wait out the time he spent off the field (10.11 pm to be precise last night) or come at the fall of five wickets, whichever was earlier.Needless to say hisIPLfans from the city he plays for began to miss him from the first ball in the chase. When Johnson Charles and Andre Fletcher walked out to bat, a chant went around the arena. It’s amazing how quickly these sort of stuff spreads around the stadium. ‘We want Gayle, We want Gayle’ – on and on they went and even when Fletcher got off to a rousing start – 23 came in first two overs – the crowd didn’t let off their rallying cry.When Dinesh Ramdin fell, West Indies had lost their third wicket, but Gayle began to move towards the boundary line. The reserve umpire Ian Gould intervened and sent him back. All this drama was caught and flashed on the big screen at the ground, and the crowd began their chants again. There was to be more drama left in the night. A moment came when it seemed Fletcher had fallen, edging to the keeper.Story continues below this adGayle was seen standing beside the boundary ropes even as Fletcher, who had begun to walk, was awaiting a decision from the third umpire. Crowd got into it again, and there was palpable excitement all around but the third umpire played killjoy. After numerous replays, he decided the ball had bounced just before it settled into the gloves and he ruled that Fletcher would stay in.A reluctant Gayle had to go back, the restless crowd had to wait more and the moment never came again. At the end of it all, Gayle came out on to the ground, and waved to his adoring ‘home’ fans. Later, Fletcher was asked about how he felt when crowd were cheering for his dismissal almost. Fletcher, his french beard widening with a lovely big smile, said, ” I don’t think they wanted me out. Chris is Chris, he is a great T20 batsman. Everyone loves to see him to bat. I also would like to see him bat!”Stay updated with the latestsports newsacrossCricket,Football,Chess, and more.

Selection row rages on at HCA,"Hyderabad: Selection snags continue to dog the Hyderabad Cricket Association even after the new body took charge last month. The latest to kick up dust is the Under 16 team for the Vijay Merchant Trophy that was announced on Sunday. While many parents have expressed displeasure at their wards being left out, one of them has written to the HCA Apex Council highlighting the raw deal meted out to his son and has listed comparative performances. He pointed out that the team was picked much before the last match for the Probables finished, depriving his allrounder son a place in the squad, which has quite a few loose ends.""Players who have scored less runs and taken fewer wickets in the Probables and B-Division two-day league matches have been included,"" bemoaned the erudite parent who requested anonymity. ""The selection has been surreptitious. In the probables matches, a batsman has been given close to 20 overs to bowl while a recognised bowler has been taken off after sending down just five,"" he added. He also listed out four players who have been picked after playing the C-Division one-day league. Matches in the Vijay Merchant Trophy are played on a three-day basis. Two players, born in 2008, have submitted Date of Birth certificates that were registered in 2022 and 2023 — 13 and 14 years respectively after they were born.

"Randeep Hooda: Some of my scenes were edited, but no complaints","September 13 was Randeep Hooda's lucky day. He walked the red carpet at the just-concluded 40th Toronto International Film Festival with the team of Deepa Mehta's upcoming crime thriller, 'Beeba Boys', which had its North American premiere at TIFF's 'Gala' section. It brought back memories of his debut film, Mira Nair's 'Monsoon Wedding', which premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival and bagged the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. “I was a kid then, hiding behind everyone else, but this time I put a sure foot forward.And though the rain ruined our parade, the standing ovation at the end of the screening was a real high,"" exults the actor.

There have been some quibbles about Deepa's film with The Hollywood Reporter saying “it's too quirky a project to travel far, and its main appeal should be to Indians in Canada and the U.S. where the offbeat humor should make the most sense."" Randeep points out that given Deepa's track record, maybe the critics were expecting a more serious film. “But the audience was laughing at the right points and enjoying the Sardar humour. And later on the streets, we were greeted with shouts of 'Hey, Beeba boys',"" he reminisces. He admits that since he had not seen the film before, there were some apprehensions. “Some of my scenes were edited, but no complaints as long as it works for the screenplay and the director.And the critics have been really kind to me. I wasn't expecting such a super response,"" he says. So, has Deepa spoken to him about her next film yet? Randeep admits that they have been discussing a lot of ideas but haven't locked on anything yet. “It's nice to collaborate with the same peo ple because you're in your comfort zone and can do things better with the communication lines more open. I have been talking to others too but talks take a long time and till things don't materialise, you don't talk about it,"" he says evasively. Randeep returned from Toronto to his home state Haryana where he's filming 'Yeh Laal Rang' via Mumbai and Delhi, jet lagged. “I got into the vanity van, into my costume, and it was a real culture shock. From Karnal to Toronto, it's been a long journey, for me as a person and as an actor too. It's heartening when locals now, clued in to my wherea bouts, thanks to the social media, ask me, “Toronto kaisa tha?"" he laughs. Meanwhile, Randeep has launched a Polo Club in Gurgaon with the intention of making polo and equestrian sport more accessible. “I don't want to bring down its aspiration quality but I want to make polo more accessible to people and clear the misconception that it is an expensive sport.

"Drained of all hope, NCR cities left to sink or swim","New Delhi/Gurugram: Roads turned into lakes, homes were flooded, walls fell, and a sea of traffic was marooned in several parts of the national capital region (NCR) on Wednesday after heavy rains exposed, yet again, the fragile state of the civic infrastructure and the lack of preparedness for a season that exposes such flaws every year. The flooding was particularly severe in Gurugram, where underpasses in some of the city’s most upscale neighbourhoods resembled a river, forcing at least two motorists to escape from their drowning cars and swim to safety, and rafts to be deployed. In Delhi, traffic backed up for several kilometres on arterial stretches on the Ring Road – especially at Ashram, Dhaula Kuan and near AIIMS – while access roads to the airport accumulated waist-deep waters. In several parts of the town, the water logging disabled cars and buses that exacerbated the jams. “Portions of roads were completely submerged in water, which slowed down vehicular movement on arterial stretches. Our officials were stationed to direct traffic, but in many areas, the situation was quite bad,” said a senior Delhi traffic police official, asking not to be named. The flooding also affected people who were at home. In residential colonies such as Krishna Nagar, Amar Colony, Model Town, Prem Nagar in Kirari, Sant Nagar and Laxmi Vihar in Burari, water entered the ground floor of several homes. “It doesn’t look like we are living in the Capital. Every year we have to experience this pain of water logging. It’s been raining since morning and the streets of colonies are completely submerged in water. It’s because of choked drains and sewer lines. Agencies keep blaming each other but it’s the public that suffers,” said BS Vohra, a resident of Krishna Nagar and the president, East Delhi RWAs Joint Front. Civic bodies reported uprooted trees in a several areas and seven cars were damaged after the boundary wall of a school in the Saket’s J block collapsed. The Minto Road under-bridge, which has become a symbol of the Delhi’s vulnerability to rain, however, had unexpectedly little water. The trigger for the chaos was 43mm of rain (average across five stations) that poured on Delhi between 8.30am and 5.30pm. Gurugram recorded 118mm of rain, close to 20% of the precipitation seen on an average in an entire year. Rainfall recorded below 15mm is considered light, 15-64.5mm is moderate and above 64.5mm is heavy. Weather officials said the rains are being caused by two low pressure bands over northwest and central India: the first is the monsoon trough, and the second due to cyclonic circulations over Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. “A low pressure area has formed and the monsoon trough is also near its normal position. A lot of rain is expected over central and NW India because of these two conditions,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD. Moderate to heavy rain is likely in NCR on Thursday. Central India may get similar conditions for 3-4 days. For Delhi, Wednesday’s rain is likely to make up for the 14% cumulative rainfall deficit this season. The national capital, however, fared better than its neighbour. In addition to the Golf Course Road underpasses (they are a network of three), four others – two each in Cyber City and along the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway – were floobe closed for traffic.","Heavy rains in New Delhi/Gurugram caused chaos, flooding roads, homes, and leading to traffic jams. Gurugram witnessed severe flooding, with motorists needing rescue and rafts deployed. In Delhi, key roads like the Ring Road and airport access roads were submerged, causing traffic congestion. Residential areas like Krishna Nagar and Model Town were affected, prompting complaints about choked drains. Uprooted trees and wall collapses were reported. The trigger was 43mm of rain in Delhi and 118mm in Gurugram. Weather officials attributed it to low pressure bands.

Meanwhile, the government decided to amend the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, to allow societies to hold annual general body meeting till March 31, 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Officials said that at least one general body meeting has to be held in five years and it is not possible for some societies to hold the same before September 30. “This will lead to society members becoming inactive, resulting in the exclusion of their names from voter lists, and preventing them from voting in future polls,” said an official. The official said the extension has been given to societies to conduct the audit of the last financial year. As per norms, societies have to carry out an audit within four months after the financial year is over. “Since it is not possible due to Covid-19, the date of audit has been extended to December 31.” The Cabinet also extended the term of the mayor and deputy mayor by three months, stating that it is not possible to hold polls amid the pandemic.","This news falls under the ""Local News"" or ""Regional News"" category, as it pertains to specific events and decisions affecting the districts of Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg in Maharashtra, India.

Gadkari defamation case: Kejriwal sent to Tihar jail,"NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal was today arrested and sent to Tihar jail till May 23 by a Delhi court after he refused to furnish bail bond in a criminal defamation complaint filed against him by BJP leader Nitin Gadkari. ""Take him into custody,"" Metropolitan Magistrate Gomati Manocha ordered after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former Delhi Chief Minister repeatedly refused to furnish a personal bail bond of Rs 10,000 and a surety of like amount. ""In these circumstances as the accused has refused to furnish bail bond or even personal bond without surety, this court is constrained to take the accused into custody. ""Let the accused be sent to judicial custody and be produced before the court on May 23,"" the magistrate said. Kejriwal was summoned as an accused by the court in the defamation complaint in which Gadkari had alleged that he was defamed by the AAP leader who had included his name on the party's list of ""India's most corrupt"". After the court pronounced its order, Kejriwal was taken into a lock up on the court premises amid tight security and later taken to Tihar jail. The magistrate, in her three-page order, also observed that the procedure of courts cannot be ""thrown to the winds"" at the whims and fancies of the litigants. ""The court cannot act as a mute spectator when a particular litigant intentionally seeks to violate the procedure established by law.

"Oil firms refrain from hiking diesel prices, but may raise it soon over revenue loss","NEW DELHI: Oil firms have spared the consumers from the monthly diesel hike, but the relief is only temporary as the government did not want to spoil the New Year party. Companies are keen to raise the price soon. Companies are suffering a huge revenue loss on the sale of diesel. The pump price is Rs 9.74/litre lower than the market rate, which is substantial, even though the gap is slightly smaller than the level of Rs 10.48 per litre two weeks ago. Industry executives say the government nudged them to avoid the increase in diesel prices, but oil ministry officials denied any role in this. Officials, however, said they appreciated the postponement as a “goodwill gesture” for the consumer. “The petroleum minister is always under political pressure against any hike in fuel prices, but he has given full freedom to oil marketing companies to raise prices by 50 paise a month as per the Cabinet decision. Despite internal pressures he did not stop them from raising prices during the recent assembly elections,” a senior oil ministry official said requesting anonymity","Oil companies have temporarily halted the monthly hike in diesel prices to avoid disrupting New Year celebrations, according to reports from New Delhi.

Is AAP saffronised?,"With its version of Hindutva, Kejriwal is challenging the BJP’s monopoly over Hindutva Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s suggestion a few days ago about printing the pictures of Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi on fresh currency notes doesn’t appear to be a one-off remark. It looks like the Aam Aadmi Party chief is consciously working on an agenda—the agenda of Hindutva. The Bharatiya Janata Party has promised in poll-bound Gujarat that it would constitute a committee, under a retired high court judge, on the implementation of the uniform civil code (UCC). Kejriwal has lambasted and lampooned the promise, saying that the saffron party is bluffing. The BJP had pledged the same thing before the Assembly election in Uttarakhand, he said. But, he added, after winning the election, “the committee went back home.” Now, just before the Gujarat poll, it talks about another committee. This committee will also go back home after the election, he quipped. He is entering a territory, that of Hindutva, over which the BJP claims to have proprietorship. For decades, the BJP had three ‘core issues’—building the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, abrogation of Article 370, and UCC. No other party showed much interest in these issues, for these were regarded as ‘communal.’ Of course, there is the Shiv Sena but it has never been focused on the core Hindutva issues; besides, it has always been a regional outfit. AAP, on the other hand, is on an expansion drive—how successful it becomes is another matter. Further, AAP was born as a ‘secular’ party, comprising a lot of Left-leaning progressive intellectuals and progressives; most of them are out of the party though; like all other parties, AAP is also heavily centralized, Kejriwal being the centre. This is the reason that public intellectuals and liberals were shocked by his view on the pictures of gods and goddesses on currency notes; but Kejriwal doesn’t care two hoots about their fulminations; now he is a politician, not an activist; realpolitik rather than radicalism guides his path. Angrier than the liberals are BJP leaders, for they have been the sole votaries of Hindutva so far. In Kejriwal and AAP, they may see not just a political rival but also an ideological adversary. They faced the quandary when responding to his gods-goddesses-on-notes gimmick; and now this guy is trying to score brownie points even on the core issue of UCC. It has become clear that he is not like other non-BJP leaders who shy away from UCC. So, what would the BJP do with the problem called Kejriwal? The saffron party may find some comfort from the fact, as we mentioned in earlier edits, that non-BJP parties playing the Hindutva card have not fared well. But then many things that have happened in the last few years never happened before; never before, for instance, did a ragtag rainbow coalition of activists and idealists coalesce into a successful political party running two state governments. But AAP did that—and now it’s getting saffronised. The BJP is rightly worried.","The article discusses Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's recent statements and actions that suggest a shift towards embracing Hindutva, a political ideology associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Kejriwal's proposal to print pictures of Hindu deities on currency notes and his criticism of the BJP's promise to constitute a committee on the uniform civil code (UCC) indicate a strategic move into the ideological territory traditionally claimed by the BJP. The BJP, known for its Hindutva agenda, has focused on issues like the Ram Temple, Article 370, and the UCC. Kejriwal, who initially positioned the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as a secular party, seems to be adopting Hindutva as part of a broader political strategy. The article suggests that Kejriwal's foray into the realm of Hindutva could pose a challenge to the BJP's ideological monopoly in Indian politics.",Politics,2022-10-31 00:00:00

Gangte, Founder Principal, Faith Theological College, government recognized and accredited by NATA & IATA, mentioned on his welcome address that FTC had come a long way since its establishment in 2009 as a residential Bible College, recognized by the Government of Nagaland. He praised God saying that the foundation laying was a milestone achievement. The Principal also reported that T.R. Zeliang, Minister, Planning and Co-ordination, Veterinary and Animal Husbandry, Evaluation and Parliamentary Affairs, who was to be the chief guest, had donated a sum of One Lakh rupees towards college fund, and thanked him for his generosity. Er. Dr. L. Yezhekhu Sumi, C.E.

Karaiba Chawang, Press Secretary to the Minister, Planning & Co-ordination graced the ceremony as chief guest on behalf of the Minister. In his speech, Chawang said that the 21st Century was a century of great challenge for the theologians. He said that today we live in a society where the Churches are getting fancier, while Faith is getting smaller, rich getting richer and poor getting poorer, where people are preaching peace but violence is everywhere, and where people preach unity but division prevails, hence today is the time the Theologians take this challenge. Comparing Christianity in Nagaland to King Solomon’s Kingdom, he said that Nagas are increasingly becoming materialistic and starting to do things in their own will. The Nagas are most confused about Christianity, where people are religious but not spiritual. Advising the Theology students, he asked them to communicate Gospel truths with the youths, as they are the most affected in the society, caught in dilemma between religion and spirituality. Further, on behalf of his Minister, T.R. Zeliang, he wished success to the College, and said that through ‘Faith’, as its name itself, the college will grow.

Govt may impose anti-dumping duty on Chinese chemical,"NEW DELHI: The government may impose anti- dumping duty of $0.23 per kg on a Chinese chemical used to manufacture explosives for mining to protect domestic players from cheap imports. In its findings, the Directorate General of Anti-dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) has recommended imposition of the duty on imports of 'Sodium Perchlorate' from China, the Commerce Ministry said in a notification. The Directorate's recommendation comes on the basis of its findings that increased imports have caused ""material injury"" to the domestic industry, it said. The DGAD, which is under the Commerce Ministry, in its recommendations said that the chemical has been exported to India below its normal value from China. ""...the Authority is of the view that imposition of definitive duty is required to offset dumping of subject goods (the chemical) into India and consequent injury caused to domestic industry,"" it said. Anti-dumping duty is recommended by the Commerce Ministry, while the Finance Ministry imposes the same. Imports of the chemical from China has increased to 1,244 tonne in 2010-11 from 628 tonne in 2008-09. Unlike safeguard duties, which are levied in a uniform way, anti-dumping duties vary from product to product and from country to country. Countries initiate anti-dumping probes to check if domestic industry has been hurt because of a surge in below- cost imports. As a counter-measure, they impose duties under the multilateral WTO regime.","The Indian government may impose an anti-dumping duty of $0.23 per kg on Chinese sodium perchlorate, a chemical used to manufacture explosives for mining.

March 19 is the last date for submission of the forms to participate in the 3G auction. The bench did not agree that 25 days’ time given for submitting the bids in the Notice for Inviting the Application of February 25 was very less and small operators would be deprived. “Transparency is there. The government has already put all the information regarding the auction on its website in October last year,” the bench said.

"India vs New Zealand Preview: India, New Zealand ready for one final push","Spotlight on top-order batters; dew likely to be a factor AHMEDABAD: The last time India lost a T20I series at home was in March 2019, when all-rounder Glenn Maxwell inspired Australia to a 2-0 series triumph. Since then, India have competed in 20 bilateral T20I series, both away and home, winning 17 of them, drawing two and losing one to Sri Lanka in 2021, when a majority of India's playing squad members were infected with Covid.India have not lost the last 12 bilateral T20I series (winning 10 and drawing 2) that they've played at home, a record they would like to keep intact when they take the field on Wednesday at the humongous Narendra Modi Stadium in Motera against a New Zealand side whose playing culture has been epitomised by their never-say-die approach. The Black Caps, who lost the ODI series, will be hoping to end their subcontinental sojourn on a winning note. The build-up to the decider has been dominated by discussions centering on the 'nature' of the pitch. New Zealand spinners out bowled their Indian counterparts and throttled India in the opening T20I in Ranchi, following which Indian captain Hardik Pandya expressed 'shock' and 'surprise' at the nature of the pitch. If that was not enough, the pitch at the Ekana in Lucknow produced a total of just 200 runs. India found the target of 100 difficult, winning in 19. 5 overs and Pandya again termed the wicket as a ""shocker of a pitch"".The strip at Motera is expected to be batting-friendly. The average total batting first at the newly-constructed stadium, which c an accommodate an estimated 132,000 people, is around 170-175. The team batting first has gone on to win the match twice while the chasing side has been successful thrice. Dew, though, is likely to play a cr ucial factor, and the team winning the toss will, in all likelihood, want to chase down a target than set one.Indian batters have not fired in unison in this series. The likes of Shubman Gill, Ishan Kishan and Rahul Tripathi failed in the first T201 while, in the second outing, all three got starts but failed to capitalize on it. They will be hoping to make their mark with a significant contribution here. While Washington Sundar saved India from a huge defeat in Ranchi, all eyes will again be on 'Mr 360' Suryakumar Yadav, who had scored an unbeaten 112 in the decider against Sri Lanka only last month. He has been consistent in the two matches but his usual flair has been missing. Pandya, too, would be eager to put on a show and end the series on a high, both with the bat and the ball.In the bowling department, off spinner Sundar, left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav and leg spinner Yuzvendra Chahal have been economical and taken wickets as well. The death bowling of left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh and tearaway pacer Umran Malik will again be put to test against the likes of big-hitting Glenn Phillips, Daryl Mitchell and Michael Bracewell. The Black Caps will hope that openers Finn Allen and Devon Conway to provide the fireworks at the top.Left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner and leg spinner Ish Sodhi have tied down the Indian middle-order batters in the first two games, and New Zealand will once again look at the duo along with Bracewell to stifle the scoring rate in the middle overs. Pacer Lockie Ferguson will spearhead the pace bowling department along with newcomer 10-T20I old Jacob Duffy.","India faces New Zealand in a crucial T20I series decider at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium, aiming to maintain their unbeaten streak in bilateral T20I series at home since March 2019. The series, currently tied, has seen intense scrutiny over pitch conditions, with India struggling in the first two matches. The Motera pitch is expected to favor batting, with an average first innings score of 170-175. Dew could influence the game, prompting the toss-winning team to prefer chasing. Indian top-order batters like Shubman Gill and Suryakumar Yadav seek better performances, while bowlers like Washington Sundar and Kuldeep Yadav aim to continue their effective spells.

Tendulkar takes centre-stage as India fights back,"James Pattinson was eased between cover and point with the precision of a sharp shooter. A back-footed punch off Peter Siddle scorched the turf. And Mitchell Starc was whipped with nonchalance. The astonishing Sachin Tendulkar took on the fast and furious men and rolled back the years to keep India in the hunt at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday. The crowd swelled as the maestro’s passion tangoed with his jaw-dropping ability. The little big man was middling the ball on a surface of dual bounce. Tendulkar’s defiant unbeaten 71 and his crucial partnerships with Cheteshwar Pujara (44) and a strokeful Virat Kohli (50 batting) saw India finish day two on a fighting 182 for three in the first Airtel Test here on Saturday. Earlier, off-spinner R. Ashwin, who made the batsmen play him off the front foot, claimed an outstanding seven for 103 as Australia was dismissed for 380. For the visitor, skipper Michael Clarke made a captivating 130; he fell attempting to strike left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja against the turn. Then, Pattinson, working up genuine speed and employed in short bursts by Clarke, rocked India at the start. M. Vijay played on to a 150 kmph fuller length delivery that swung in and Virender Sehwag, wearing glasses, had an off-cutter hit willow, bounce off the ground and fall on the stumps. Deliberate ploy Tendulkar, in a deliberate ploy, batted with a slightly open stance. While such a strategy could come in the way of a batsman driving fluently on the off-side, it also gave him a better view of deliveries on or around the off-stump. Incoming deliveries from pacemen have troubled him this season, however, Tendulkar’s feet and willow moved in harmony to shut out any gap between the two essential elements of batsmanship. His reflexes have been hotly debated in recent times, but, Tendulkar, approaching 40, was hardly bothered by express deliveries from the Australian fast bowlers. Indeed, he was picking the length quicker than batsmen more than a decade younger. And balance, that critical aspect of batting, was on view as Tendulkar bisected the gaps. His wrists came into play at the last moment as the ball was directed between the fielders. The innings was marked by fluency and grace. Perhaps, Tendulkar was fortunate on 37 when he padded up to off-spinner Nathan Lyon and received the benefit of doubt to a vociferous leg-before shout. He carried on without being distracted. The ball reversed for the Aussie pacemen but Tendulkar displayed a straight bat. At Chepauk, his favourite hunting ground, the gifted Indian assumed centre-stage. Tendulkar and Pujara raised 93 for the third wicket in 23.2 overs. The technically pleasing Pujara displayed a sound defence as left-armer Starc tested him from round the wicket. Starc donned the role of a stock bowler but has serious wicket-taking skills. Pujara impressed with his cuts, and one such stroke off Siddle sped to the fence. The right-hander looked good for more when he was done in by a quick Pattinson delivery that seamed in from a back-of-a-length. Tendulkar, then, cleverly dropped anchor as Kohli waded into the Australian bowling. The duo has so far put on 77 runs in 23.2 overs. Cutting, driving and punching through cover and point, Kohli was severe on the Aussie spinners and five of his seven boundaries came against the unimpressive Lyon and Clarke’s left-arm spin. The enterprising Kohli also gloriously on-drove Siddle to the fence. Earlier, India made heavy weather of cleaning up the Australian tail even after Clarke departed. The Aussie strategy on day two was to bat as long as possible and allow the pitch to deteriorate. There are already a few marks on the track. Scoreboard: Australia — 1st innings: E.

Chilly weather greets Indians,"Indian cricket teams are often well received here in Birmingham — a large and vibrant expatriate community attends to the minor hankerings inevitable on long tours — but on Monday morning, M.S. Dhoni's men were greeted frostily. Not by the fans, who gathered as usual to take photographs and get mini-bats autographed, but by the weather. A chilly wind whistled around Edgbaston, which, refurbished recently, looks fetching in its indigo-blue trimmings. Sweatered and jacketed, the Indians took in the ground on which they hope to stage a comeback. Edgbaston's revamp has cost a little over £30 million, of which 600,000 has been spent on installing a new drainage system. The capacity has been increased to 25,000; only Lord's can accommodate more in England. But amidst the cheer of renewal was a moment of darkness. Warwickshire was docked eight points for producing a “poor” pitch for the game against Worcestershire; an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) panel ruled that the wicket had demonstrated “excessive unevenness of bounce”. It's an embarrassment Edgbaston will look to avoid at all costs. Warwickshire officials were quick to point out that the strip used for the match against Worcestershire was cut on the edge of the wicket-square. The pitch for the Test match is at the centre. It has also been subjected to rigorous preparation for a while now. It had a thick covering of green grass on Monday; while this is likely to be shaved, it's a sign that the surface is healthy. Stepehen Rouse, the groundsman, has had trouble in the past — 2005 and 2009 were especially bad for him — with rain in the lead-up to a Test match. On those occasions, he said the pitch was like jelly; it hadn't time to harden as he'd have liked. Rouse has had much better weather this time around. (Although Monday was cold to begin with, the sun came out after the Indians left, in time for the English session.) The wicket has a reputation for being on the slower side. The practice pitches, which are located outside the ground, were sticky and played slow. Jeetan Patel, the New Zealand off-spinner who has turned out for Warwickshire this season, said most of the pitches he bowled on have been similar. He added, however, that the Test match strip could be different — it could play slightly better because it had been worked on for longer. Spinners have had success — Saeed Ajmal took five and Graeme Swann, six, in the last Test played here. Jeetan Patel, who watched the Indians practise, said the spinners got into the game later. The quicker bowlers, he said, would find swing — the construction of a newer, bigger grandstand hadn't changed this. Edgbaston has had enough for the bowlers: no team has made more than 450 in the last seven years. Still, captains winning the toss have tended to bat. Each of the last four Tests here has followed this script, but never has it been successful. The side batting second has won thrice; the other was a draw. The Indian practice session on Monday was structured along familiar lines: a game of football, a set of fielding routines, and a long stint at the nets. Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, and Rahul Dravid were the first to bat, switching between the fast-bowlers' net, the spinners' net, and the ‘throwdown' net. Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S. Laxman, and M.S. Dhoni replaced them. Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli were the last of the batsmen to have a hit. Amit Mishra was third man in their rota. Mishra and Pragyan Ojha had earlier bowled together. Ojha's quicker left-arm spin found better response from the surface — not surprising, for tacky strips take finger-spin better than wrist-spin. Ishant Sharma, Sreesanth, and Praveen Kumar bowled as well, Ishant striving and succeeding in finding rhythm. Dhoni struggled again with his batting, and asked for seconds. The conditions in England test his lack of footwork more stringently than any other place in the world. Batsmen without footwork have succeeded here of course — Majid Khan, the great Pakistan batsman, made a case study of it at Glamorgan. But they do it because of how well they adjust their hands. Their hands take them to places their feet can't. Laxman and, on occasion, Dravid have shown how it's done. Dhoni hasn't managed it as yet. (He also, surprisingly, didn't do any wicket-keeping work on Monday). He has another session before the third Test to sort it out.","The Indian cricket team faces a chilly reception in Birmingham due to the cold weather as they prepare for the upcoming Test match at Edgbaston. Despite the refurbished stadium's impressive features, there's concern over the pitch quality following Warwickshire's recent penalty for a poor pitch. Groundsman Stephen Rouse ensures rigorous preparation for the Test match, aiming for a healthy surface. The slow nature of the pitch is noted, favoring spinners like Saeed Ajmal and Graeme Swann. Indian batsmen, including Dhoni, focus on training, with Dhoni particularly struggling with footwork adjustments.",Sports,2011-08-09 00:00:00
Robots hit the streets as demand for food delivery grows in US,"Robot food delivery is no longer the stuff of science fiction. But you may not see it in your neighborhood anytime soon. Hundreds of little robots __ knee-high and able to hold around four large pizzas __ are now navigating college campuses and even some city sidewalks in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere. While robots were being tested in limited numbers before the coronavirus hit, the companies building them say pandemic-related labor shortages and a growing preference for contactless delivery have accelerated their deployment. “We saw demand for robot usage just go through the ceiling,” said Alastair Westgarth, the CEO of Starship Technologies, which recently completed its 2 millionth delivery. “I think demand was always there, but it was brought forward by the pandemic effect.” Starship has more than 1,000 robots in its fleet, up from just 250 in 2019. Hundreds more will be deployed soon. They’re delivering food on 20 U.S. campuses; 25 more will be added soon. They’re also operating on sidewalks in Milton Keynes, England; Modesto, California; and the company’s hometown of Tallin, Estonia. Robot designs vary; some have four wheels and some have six, for example. But generally, they use cameras, sensors, GPS and sometimes laser scanners to navigate sidewalks and even cross streets autonomously. They move around 5 mph. Remote operators keep tabs on multiple robots at a time but they say they rarely need to hit the brakes or steer around an obstacle. When a robot arrives at its destination, customers type a code into their phones to open the lid and retrieve their food. The robots have drawbacks that limit their usefulness for now. They’re electric, so they must recharge regularly. They’re slow, and they generally stay within a small, pre-mapped radius. They’re also inflexible. A customer can’t tell a robot to leave the food outside the door, for example. And some big cities with crowded sidewalks, like New York, Beijing and San Francisco, aren’t welcoming them. But Bill Ray, an analyst with the consulting firm Gartner, says the robots make a lot of sense on corporate or college campuses, or in newer communities with wide sidewalks. “In the places where you can deploy it, robot delivery will grow very quickly,” Ray said. Ray said there have been few reports of problems with the robots, other than an occasional gaggle of kids who surround one and try to confuse it. Starship briefly halted service at the University of Pittsburgh in 2019 after a wheelchair user said a robot blocked her access to a ramp. But the university said deliveries resumed once Starship addressed the issue. Patrick Sheck, a junior at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, gets deliveries from a Starship robot three or four times a week as he’s leaving class. “The robot pulls up just in time for me to get some lunch,” Sheck said. Bowling Green and Starship charge $1.99 plus a service fee for each robot delivery. Rival Kiwibot, with headquarters in Los Angeles and Medellin, Columbia, says it now has 400 robots making deliveries on college campuses and in downtown Miami. Delivery companies are also jumping into the market. Grubhub recently partnered with Russian robot maker Yandex to deploy 50 robots on the campus of Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. Grubhub plans to add more campuses soon, although the company stresses that the service won’t go beyond colleges for now. U.S. delivery orders jumped 66% in the year ending in June, according to NPD, a data and consulting firm. And delivery demand could remain elevated even after the pandemic eases because customers have gotten used to the convenience. Ji Hye Kim, chef and managing partner of the Ann Arbor, Michigan, restaurant Miss Kim, relied heavily on robot delivery when her dining room was closed last year. Kim had partnered with a local robot company, Refraction AI, shortly before the pandemic began. Kim prefers robots to third-party delivery companies like DoorDash, which charge significantly more and sometimes cancel orders if they didn’t have enough drivers. Delivery companies also bundle multiple orders per trip, she said, so food sometimes arrives cold. Robots take just one order at a time. Kim said the robots also excite customers, who often post videos of their interactions. “It’s very cute and novel, and it didn’t have to come face to face with people. It was a comfort,” Kim said. Delivery demand has dropped off since her dining room reopened, but robots still deliver around 10 orders per day. While Kim managed to hang on to her staff throughout the pandemic, other restaurants are struggling to find workers. In a recent survey, 75% of U.S. restaurant owners told the National Restaurant Association that recruiting and retaining employees is their biggest challenge. That has many restaurants looking to fill the void with robot delivery. “There is no store in the country right now with enough delivery drivers,” said Dennis Maloney, senior vice president and chief digital officer at Domino’s Pizza. Domino’s is partnering with Nuro, a California startup whose 6-foot-tall self-driving pods go at a maximum speed of 25 mph on streets, not sidewalks. Nuro is testing grocery and food delivery in Houston, Phoenix and Mountain View, California. Maloney said it’s not a question of if, but of when, robots will start doing more deliveries. He thinks companies like Domino’s will eventually use a mix of robots and drivers depending on location. Sidewalk robots could work on a military base, for example, while Nuro is ideal for suburbs. Highway driving would be left to human workers. Maloney said Nuro delivery is more expensive than using human drivers for now, but as the technology scales up and gets more refined, the costs will go down. For cheaper sidewalk robots __ which cost an estimated $5,000 or less __ it’s even easier to undercut human delivery costs. The average Grubhub driver in Ohio makes $47,650 per year, according to the job site Indeed.com. But robots don’t always cost delivery jobs. In some cases, they help create them. Before Starship’s robots arrived, Bowling Green didn’t offer delivery from campus dining spots. Since then, it has hired more than 30 people to serve as runners between kitchens and robots, Bowling Green dining spokesman Jon Zachrich said. Brendan Witcher, a technology analyst with the consulting firm Forrester, says it’s easy to get excited about the Jetsons-like possibility of robot delivery. But ultimately, robots will have to prove they create an advantage in some way. “It’s possible that we see this emerge into something else,” he said. “But it’s the right time and place for companies considering robots to test them and learn from them and do their own evaluation.”","Robot food delivery is growing rapidly, driven by pandemic-related labor shortages and demand for contactless services. Companies like Starship Technologies and Kiwibot have deployed hundreds of robots on college campuses and in select cities, navigating sidewalks autonomously. These robots are slow, require recharging, and work within small areas, but offer a convenient and cost-effective alternative to human delivery drivers, especially in areas with wide sidewalks. While some challenges remain, such as accessibility issues, robots are creating new jobs and could become more common in the future, especially for smaller or suburban deliveries.",Science and Technology,2021-11-02 00:00:00

During the period, Honda?s net sales went up 94.4% to Rs 8,828.7 crore against Rs 4,1541.6 crore a year ago.Honda saw two key launches in FY14 ? the entry-level sedan Amaze and the new City ? that helped the carmaker nearly double its market-share from 3% in FY13 to 5.8% at the end of FY14. “Honda’s new launches in FY14 significantly helped the company improve its topline,” said Pramod Amthe, auto analyst, CIMB. “The issue here is not how soon will the company break even but the fact that Honda needs to sustain the growth momentum and build on it further. In addition, competition is only getting extensive, and they need to make at least some profit this fiscal as a build- on from last year’s launches and a successful foray into a new segment, the MPV Mobilio, this year,” he said. ?Your company managed to post its highest ever annual domestic sales of 134,339 units during the financial year 2013-14, registering overall y-o-y growth of 83%. The strong response from the market for the Honda Amaze and All New Honda City has been the driving force for this record achievement,? the company said in the RoC filing. ?With the launch of the Honda Amaze in April 2013, your company has started its journey in the diesel segment which has received an overwhelming response from the market,? it said.","Honda Cars India's strategy of introducing diesel models has proven successful, despite ongoing financial losses.

Right to cool,"Laws that discriminate against women on the basis of their anatomy are regressive Liberal attitudes take a while coming. They have to first swim against the tide of tradition and dogma. One such attitude is the male, ‘friendly paternal’ instinct to decree thatwomen remain chaste and modest. What is worse is the Government borrowing this attitude to justify the need for laws to protect a woman from a man’s gaze. The result, ironically, victimises the woman as the laws declare, for example, that it is a crime for a woman to move topless in public. That simply showshow centuries of struggles later women still have a lot many glass ceilings to conquer. One of them, relating to the woman’s inalienable right to her body and already a movement in the West, is female toplessness. That is women’s next frontier in gender equality in some European countries. Germany cracked it first. Göttingen becomes the first German city to allow bathers to swim topless in public polls over the weekends from May Day. The bathers can be male and female. The city council’s decision is being hailed as a further step towards gender equality. Some residents are disappointed the liberation is only for weekends. Incidentally, Germany has a popular nudist movement. It is not about sexualising the body but promoting naturism, freeing people from shame, and social inequality and encouraging body culture. However, bans on public nudity and naked swimming led to a decline in nudism. The Gottingen experiment may just revive that culture. It simply tells us that it is as cool for a woman to jump into a pool topless as it is for a man to take off his shirt on a hot summer day. The problem with most of the world is nobody will bat an eyelid upon gazing at a hairy chest, but a woman doing the same thing will drag her to the nearest police station for violating ‘public decency’. One by one, we are revoking outdated traditions that subjected women to a second-grade citizen’s status. Even the armed forces, which are the slowest in amending traditions, currently allow women into their ranks and even give them combat roles. Then why insist on laws that discriminate based on a woman’s anatomy? The principle in question is not about topless bathing but understanding a woman’s right, and need, to cool off in public.","The article discusses the recent decision by the city council of Göttingen, Germany, to allow bathers, both male and female, to swim topless in public pools during weekends. The move is seen as a step towards gender equality and challenges traditional norms surrounding female toplessness.

The author argues that such changes reflect the ongoing efforts to revoke outdated traditions that subjected women to second-class citizenship and questions the need for laws that discriminate based on a woman's anatomy.

Scrap archaic insurance laws: Shriram chief,"It is time to scrap the archaic insurance laws of the country as these have become major impediments for the growth of industry. The Indian government should empower the regulator IRDA (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority) as a single entity that is responsible and accountable for the performance of insurance sector, asserted insurance industry veteran and founder-Chairman of the Shriram Group R. Thyagarajan. He said about 95 per cent of the Insurance Act 1938 could be scrapped as they were only proving to be barriers for the growth of the Indian insurance sector. Also, absence of accountability - be it for insurance department or IRDA - was also a concern, he said. He pointed out that an empowered IRDA could formulate necessary regulations to govern the sector. He felt that there was no need for two different entities – Centre’s finance ministry and the sectoral regulator IRDA. “If IRDA is totally empowered, they can be made responsible. They can’t hide behind Insurance Act and say they are constrained by the Act to effect any change,” he added. Elaborating on the outdated laws in the Act, he said Section 41, brought during British period, didn’t have any relevance in the current context as all products and pricing were market-based. “This provision was added after a lobbying by the British as a protection against domestic competition,” he pointed out. Though the industry had been urging for the removal of the rebating practice, there was a move to make the penalty much higher: from Rs.500 earlier to Rs. 5 lakh under the new Insurance Bill, which is awaiting Parliament nod. There was fear that increased penalty would lead to harassment of agents, resulting in bribery and corruption, he said. Admitting that there was a certain amount of mis-selling in the insurance industry, he pointed out that only less or lower level of regulations would be the solution to remove such practices. “A streamlined or rationalised regulatory framework will pave the way for a healthy insurance sector in the country,” he added. Due to outdated laws, life insurance sector’s business had come down by 8-10 per cent in the last six years. It should have actually gone up by high single-digit, Mr. Thyagarajan felt.","Insurance industry veteran R.

One-third DTC drivers are unfit,"On Thursday, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) yet again exposed the poor training it gives to its drivers before putting them behind the wheels. One of its drivers rammed a bus into an Army school truck, killing a student and injuring several others. Incidents like these should come as no surprise as nearly one-third of DTC drivers examined by the reputed Institute of Driversâ€™ Training and Research (IDTR) last year failed the driving tests. IDTR found 28 per cent DTC drivers were unfit, as compared to 12 per cent a year ago. They evaluated about 4,500 drivers (of both DTC and private operators) and 1,177 of them failed the test. IDTR director R K Parimoo said: â€˜â€˜Many drivers had poor eyesight. While DTC drivers may be a shade better than those running the private buses, most of them had slow responses."" Experts say timely response to impromptu situations is extremely crucial. â€˜â€˜It can make the difference between life and death,"" said Gautam Chatterjee, an author of books on road safety. ""Being elderly, many drivers suffer from health problems,"" said Rohit Baluja, director of Institute of Road Traffic Education. But DTC, instead of training them at IDTR, prefers to give them in-house training at their driving training school at Nand Nagari. The average age of DTC drivers is between 45 and 55 years. ""Drivers are interested in earning money by working overtime. They stretch their physical and mental limits,â€� said a DTC official. On an average, a driver in DTC earns between somewhere between Rs 8,000 and Rs 10,000, but most of them go beyond their scheduled eight-hour schedule. â€˜â€˜We earn about Rs 40-45 per hour and generally manage to work for about 12 hours a day. Even if we do this 15 days a month, it fetches us about Rs 2,700 extra,"" said a DTC driver.","A tragic incident involving a Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus colliding with an Army school truck highlights the inadequate training given to DTC drivers. Nearly one-third of DTC drivers examined by the Institute of Drivers' Training and Research (IDTR) failed driving tests last year, with many exhibiting poor eyesight and slow responses. Experts emphasize the importance of timely reactions in avoiding accidents. Despite the availability of external training at IDTR, DTC prefers in-house training at Nand Nagari. Elderly drivers, often experiencing health issues, are common in DTC, driven by financial incentives to work overtime. Drivers earn Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 monthly, supplemented by extra hours for additional income.",DEFENCE,2003-02-21 00:00:00
Supreme Court verdict in Chandigarh mayoral election offers a timely fillip to opposition parties,"On February 20, the Supreme Court overturned the disputed Chandigarh mayoral election result and declared the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate Kuldeep Kumar victorious in the controversial Municipal Corporation election. The decision, coming ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election, is viewed as a timely boost to opposition parties, particularly after the recent striking down of the electoral bonds scheme by the top court, declaring it “unconstitutional”. The scheme was introduced by the Modi government in 2018. Court observers and political analysts believe that the significance of the judgement extends beyond the Union Territory’s urban civic body. They note that it was for the first time in independent India’s history that votes were counted within the country’s highest court. So, they argue, the ruling addresses broader questions about how the judiciary should function regarding matters concerning the health of democracy.","On February 20, the Supreme Court overturned the Chandigarh mayoral election result, declaring AAP's Kuldeep Kumar the winner. Analysts see this unprecedented courtroom vote count as a broader statement on judicial responsibility in safeguarding democracy. The ruling, following the electoral bonds verdict, offers momentum to opposition forces before the 2024 elections.",Politics,2024-02-23 00:00:00
Columns: Last chance for Japan?,"Just as the US and China have much to gain by transforming their economies, Japan is running out of time Japan is the petri dish for the struggle against the secular stagnation that is now gripping most major developed economies. And, notwithstanding all of the fanfare surrounding ?Abenomics,? Japan?s economy remains moribund. In the six quarters of Shinzo Abe?s latest stint as prime minister, annualised real GDP growth has averaged just 1.4%?up only slightly from the anemic post-1992 average of 1%. Abenomics, with its potentially powerful combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus, coupled with a wide array of structural reforms, was supposed to end Japan?s ?lost decades.? All three ?arrows? of the strategy were to be aimed at freeing the economy from a 15-year deflationary quagmire. Unfortunately, not all of the arrows have been soaring in flight. The Bank of Japan seems well on its way to delivering on the first one?embracing what it calls quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE). Relative to GDP, the BOJ?s monetary-policy gambit could actually far outstrip the efforts of America?s Federal Reserve. But the flight of the other two arrows is shaky, at best. In recent days, Abe has raised serious questions about proceeding with the second phase of a previously legislated consumer-tax hike that has long been viewed as the linchpin of Japan?s debt-consolidation strategy. Abe has flinched because the economy remains weak, posing renewed risks of a deflationary relapse. Meanwhile, the third arrow of structural reforms?especially tax, education, and immigration reforms?is nowhere near its target. Abenomics, one might conclude, is basically a Japanese version of the failed policy combination deployed in the United States and Europe: massive unconventional liquidity injections by central banks (with the European Central Bank apparently now poised to follow the Fed), but little in the way of fundamental fiscal and structural reforms. The political expedience of the short-term monetary fix has triumphed once again. Such a gamble is especially problematic for Japan. With an aging?and now declining?working-age population, it has limited scope for reviving growth. Japan must either squeeze more out of its existing workforce by boosting productivity, or uncover new sources of demand at home or abroad. At home, that could mean adding workers, either by boosting female participation in the work force, which, at 63%, is among the lowest in the developed world, or relaxing immigration restrictions. Unfortunately, there has been little progress on either front. Moreover, even if the political will to launch third-arrow structural reforms were suddenly to strengthen?a dubious proposition?any productivity payback would most likely take a long time to materialise. That leaves external demand, which underscores what is perhaps Abenomics? most serious strategic flaw: It does not take into consideration some of the biggest changes that are likely to occur in the global economy. That is a great pity, because Japan is well positioned to take advantage of one of the most powerful global trends?the coming rebalancing of the Chinese and US economies. China appears to be more committed to restructuring than the US?at least for the foreseeable future. Its Third Plenum reforms provide a cohesive framework for a pro-consumption transformation. Though America currently remains intent on resurrecting a tired growth model, there is good reason to hope that it, too, will eventually rebalance. Japan cannot afford to squander these opportunities. As the main driver of Chinese growth shifts from external to domestic demand, who could benefit more than Japanese exporters? China is already Japan?s largest export market, leaving it ideally situated to capture additional market share in the coming surge of Chinese demand for consumer products and services. Likewise, Japan stands to benefit from its technological prowess in environmental remediation?an urgent priority for China in the years ahead. Japan already has great expertise in many of the solutions to some of China?s toughest problems. Japan is also likely to gain from a long-overdue rebalancing of the US economy. A shift in the US?from excessive consumption of goods largely sourced in low-wage developing countries to the capital equipment that an increasingly investment-led economy will require?would play to Japan?s greatest strengths. As a global leader in sophisticated machinery and the earth-moving equipment needed for infrastructure investment, Japan should be able to to seize these opportunities. In looking to external demand, Japan should not lose sight of its earlier achievements. In the 1970s and 1980s, Japan was the envy of the world, owing to an all-powerful export machine that tapped the demand of a rapidly growing global economy. ?Japan, Inc.? still has a good institutional memory of what it takes to draw support from external demand. It is time to recapture that memory. Failure to do so would leave Japan, the world?s third largest economy, at risk of being further marginalised by transformations in the world?s two largest, the US and China. There is one obvious and important caveat: Poor Sino-Japanese relations, owing to unresolved historical grievances, could prevent Japan from realising the economic benefits implied by China?s economic rebalancing. The interplay between economics and politics lies at the heart of the rise and fall of great powers. In a rapidly changing world, underscored by likely shifts in the economic structure of China and the US, Japan cannot afford to lose sight of that fact. Just as the US and China have much to gain by transforming their economies, Japan is running out of time. In the grip of two lost decades and counting, this could be Japan?s last chance.","Japan faces a critical moment in its economic journey, with the country struggling against secular stagnation despite the ambitious policies of Abenomics. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's strategy, encompassing monetary and fiscal stimulus along with structural reforms, aimed to pull Japan out of its prolonged economic malaise. However, results have been lackluster, with real GDP growth averaging only 1.4% during Abe's tenure. The first arrow of Abenomics, monetary easing through the Bank of Japan's quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE), has been implemented robustly. However, the other two arrows—fiscal stimulus and structural reforms—have not achieved their targets. The planned consumer-tax hike, crucial for debt consolidation, is now uncertain due to fears of deflationary relapse. Structural reforms in tax, education, and immigration have also made little progress.",International News,2014-10-31 00:00:00
Mechanical engineer from Mumbai's Chembur school becomes first man to win Arjuna award for mallakhamb,"Two hands that design fibreglass pipes in a Govandi office by day and help him slither up a teakwood pole in a Chembur school by night had to deal with a very different element recently: a gold-plated statuette of a kneeling warrior. Mechanical engineer Sagar Ovhalkar, 25, was presented the Arjuna award at Rashtrapati Bhavan on November 30, becoming the second mallakhamb athlete to win India's second-highest sporting honour. ""I'm the first male mallakhamb gymnast to get it,"" said the winner of three gold and two silver medals at the 2019 World Mallakhamb Championships (WMC). Last year, 21-year-old Himani Parab of Dadar had bagged the honour. The Arjuna long eluded mallakhamb, an earthy martial art form that likely originated in 12th-century Maharashtra and flourished on the margins of wrestling. TV talent shows began sprinkling a bit of glamour dust some years ago, but it was only after the 2019 WMC, which drew enthusiasts from 15 countries arcing from the US to Vietnam, that it was recognised as an 'indigenous sport', opening the portal to Arjunas. Since then, Chembur's Ovhalkar has watched mallakhamb ascend the totem pole in terms of facilities and fortunes, apart from food. Mallakhamb Arjuna winner specialises in one-arm poses Since the Centre recognised mallakhamb as an 'indigenous sport' in 2019, fortunes of exponents have been looking up. ""Earlier, we would perform outside in the heat. Now, we compete in air-conditioned arenas,"" said Sagar Ovhalkar, who won the Arjuna award this year. Not only are players put up in hotels instead of ad-hoc local dormitories, they also receive track suits instead of T-shirts, added Ovhalkar, who has covered the length from Bengaluru to Ujjain for national competitions. He rattled off other recent upgrades at inter-state and national championships. With the inclusion of mallakhamb in Khelo India Youth games, the number of domestic tournaments has risen from one a year to at least four, said Ovhalkar, adding that training centres in various cities now have crash mats and harnesses. Every day after wrapping up work as a project engineer in charge of supplying pipes and other equipment to oil refineries in countries such as Iraq and Nigeria, the 25-year-old lathers his hands and thighs with castor oil to keep them from chafing against the rope and the pole at his alma mater, Jawahar Vidya Bhavan. It was here that Ovhalkar's six-year-old body had gravitated towards the martial art form in the first standard, inspired by elder brother, Rakesh. After having fallen off the rope once as a young boy, Ovhalkar--who trained under the watchful gaze of coach Sanjay Raichurkar and, later, Sunil Gangawane-- grew up preferring the pole version of the sport to the rope variant that tended to burn his hands and thighs. ""Flawless execution in pole, rope and hanging mallakhamb,"" said Vivek Sable of Mallakhamb Federation of Japan when asked about the strengths of Ovhalkar, who had dazzled Sable at the WMC in 2019. Among the first students at his school to try out arm-balance yoga poses such as 'bakasana (crow pose)' and 'titibasana (firefly pose)' atop the pole, ""I'd always get full marks in execution"", said Ovhalkar, who had led the national team at the WMC in 2019 where he had stunned with his signature 'element (pose)' called the 'one-hand straddle'. Sophisticated facilities such as harnesses in local centres, apart from the sport's inclusion in the Olympics, can help the sport attain the professional heights of kabaddi, believes Ovhalkar, who plans to use his recent cash prize of Rs 15 lakh on getting imported equipment at his school and paying off his home loan. Ovhalkar is happy to note the rising local curiosity in the wake of his win. A Thane school principal who invited him recently wants to include mallakhamb in its sports curriculum, he says.","Sagar Ovhalkar, a mechanical engineer and Arjuna Awardee in mallakhamb, highlights the sport's evolution since its recognition in 2019. With upgraded facilities and increased domestic tournaments, Ovhalkar aims to elevate mallakhamb to professional heights akin to kabaddi, using his cash prize to improve infrastructure and foster local interest.",Human Interest,2022-12-18 00:00:00

Review: A Natural History of Violence by Ankush Saikia,"Set in New Delhi, this whydunit is devoted to a hunt for truth that spans generations of a family and unravels the story behind a gruesome patricide It is 2018, and the gruesome, cold-blooded murder of DCP Virender Bedi by his son Vikrant Bedi in their Delhi home sends shock waves through the capital. The Express sends its finest reporter Ruchi to cover the case. While there is no doubt as to who the murderer is, the “why” haunts Ruchi. Why would a son slit his father’s throat and then eat biryani while waiting for the police to arrive and apprehend him?So begins Ankush Saikia’s remarkable whydunit, A Natural History of Violence, a novel devoted to a hunt for truth that spans generations of the Bedi family. Saikia maintains a fine balance between the present and the past as he takes the reader for an engaging romp through Delhi’s history going as far back as the Independence movement. The story of the Bedi family is deeply intertwined with the story of India as a young nation and of Delhi as its capital. Saikia’s Delhi is one that built the fortunes of many and offered a fresh start to those who arrive during the Partition. It chronicles the influx of survivors and the building of refugee colonies. While the city’s contemporary portrayal is nuanced and relatable, readers who have lived in Delhi will appreciate the care and attention Saikia pays to capturing the flavour of life in the capital. Right from the cops to the swear words, the traffic lights and the farmhouse parties, this is Delhi in all its explicit and honest glory. Apart from being an investigative story with a pacy plot, Saikia’s novel is also a moving rendition of how grief travels through generations. As Ruchi untangles the father-son bond within the Bedi family she is forced to look at her own. When her husband disciplines her child harshly, she begins to wonder about the nature of the bond between father and son. As she explores the Bedi family tree it seems that fathers and sons have always had issues, leaving the women to pick up the pieces – a pattern she sees cropping up in her own family. Through the Bedi clan, Saikia charts a moving path of intergenerational grief and coping mechanisms that, at various points, drive family members to drink. In many ways, the recorded history of our nation minimises society’s fault lines, ignoring the desperation and hopelessness of its weakest members. When a young Lakhbir Singh sees his father killed in front of him by a communal mob, he never recovers; his mother withdraws into herself. When Lakhbir’s son is born with physical disabilities, his entire family collapses and his wife, like his mother, withdraws into herself leaving a lonely and tired Lakhbir to the bottle.What Saikia manages to capture quite well in this story is the role of the past as a mediating force for our present relationships. Vikrant’s reasons for his father’s murder are linked to his past as are his father’s actions linked to those of his father and so on. The reader, like Ruchi, soon realizes, as they travel through these labyrinths of time, that the sooner the characters acknowledge where they come from, the sooner they will make peace with their true selves. It’s a peace that is the beginning of their transformation into who they want to be. This is evident in Vikrant, the last descendant of the Bedi family. Though he is imprisoned by his past like his forefathers, he decides to turn his life around.A Natural History of Violence is a quick read. The characters are few and primacy is given to moving the story forward. The only weakness it might have is perhaps its laser focus on the plot, which takes away from the development of its cast. Apart from the few primary players, most of the cast is on a need-to-know basis with their development being a bit of an afterthought. Like Ruchi’s husband and her colleague, they appear superficial and unidimensional. More space and energy could have been devoted to their development for the reader to be invested in getting to know them. For instance, we never do find out the source of Farzan’s contempt for Delhiites apart from the fact that he isn’t one.Overall, though, A Natural History of Violence makes for an engrossing read. Propelled by Saikia’s clutter-free narration and engaging plot line, it is an accurate portrayal of life in the capital.","Set in New Delhi, Ankush Saikia's ""A Natural History of Violence"" is a gripping whydunit exploring the patricide of DCP Virender Bedi by his son Vikrant. The narrative, spanning generations of the Bedi family, intertwines with Delhi's history from the Independence movement.

Joshimath: Sinking Town In Indian Himalayas Spotlights Risks Of Development,"A sinking Himalayan town is highlighting the dangers posed to the region and the fragile ecology of the mountain range disturbed by a proliferation of dams, roads and military sites near the border with China. The risks, flagged for decades by environmentalists and activists, came to the fore recently after land subsidence — gradual sinking due to displacement of underground earth layers — led to cracks in hundreds of homes in the tiny town of Joshimath, located at an altitude of over 6,000 feet (1,830 meters) in the northern hill state of Uttarakhand. The high seismic risk zone is dotted with several picturesque towns and villages that are gateways to hiking trails, Hindu pilgrimage sites and strategic outposts in India’s lingering border dispute with China. The region is already vulnerable to frequent extreme weather events and landslides. A massive cloudburst in 2013 left more than 5,000 dead in the state. Four hydropower projects with a combined projected cost of about 155 billion rupees ($1.9 billion) are currently under construction in Uttarakhand. “The villages and townships in the northern part of Uttarakhand are located along the major active thrust zones within the Himalayas and are very sensitive because of the fragile ecosystem of the region,” said Rajeev Upadhyay, professor of geology at the Kumaun University in Nainital. “Many habitations, which are built on the debris of old landslides, are already under natural stress and man-made constructions are adding further stress to the region.” Incidents of land sinking in the Joshimath area were reported as early as the 1970s. A rapid subsidence of a maximum of 5.4 centimeters was triggered in Joshimath town in the 12 days up to Jan. 8. Slow subsidence of a maximum of 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) was recorded in the seven months leading to November last year, according to a statement and satellite images released by the National Remote Sensing Centre of the Indian Space Research Organisation. “If you do a lot of excessive mechanical activities in the region, the land will be prone to slide,” said Upadhyay. “The whole area is vulnerable to subsidence.” Here are some places in Uttarakhand that could be at risk: Joshimath: The site of the current disaster is a major military and administrative hub. Millions of devotees cross this garrison town each year to reach Badrinath, a holy town for Hindus. The state-run NTPC Ltd. is working on a hydroelectric power project nearby. India’s top court will hear a petition from a local religious leader next week seeking to halt construction of the power project blaming it for the damage. NTPC, India’s biggest power producer, has denied its construction activities led to land subsidence. The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has released satellite images of Joshimath and a preliminary report on land subsidence which shows that the entire town may sink. The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has released satellite images of Joshimath. The images and preliminary report on land subsidence shows that the entire town may sink. The entire town, including the Army's helipad and the Narasimha temple, has been marked as sensitive zone. Uttarakhand government is conducting rescue operation in danger-prone areas and the people in these areas are being shifted to safer places on priority. According to the report, the land subsidence was slow between April and November 2022, during which Joshimath had sunk by 8.9 cm. But between December 27, 2022 and January 8, 2023, the intensity of land subsidence increased and the town sank by 5.4 cm in these 12 days. The satellite images show that the Joshimath-Auli road is also going to collapse due to the land subsidence Tehri: Cracks have appeared in some houses in the region. The nearby Tehri Dam is India’s tallest dam and one of the largest hydroelectric power projects. It’s also a popular tourist destination. The project also raised concerns about the environmental problems of locating a large dam in the delicate ecosystem of the Himalayan foothills. Mana: Considered the last Indian village at the border with China, it’s also a key military installation where troop strength was boosted after the latest India-China border stand-off erupted in the summer of 2020. India has relocated some troops from areas surrounding Joshimath, Army Chief Manoj Pande, said Thursday. Mana is being linked with a national highway, part of a project promoted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to improve connectivity between Hindu pilgrimage sites. Environmental groups have raised concern about the project saying the felling of trees in the wildlife-rich area will increase landslide risks.

The satellite images show that the Joshimath-Auli road is also going to collapse due to the land subsidence. Dharasu: The hill town has a landing ground critical for both locals as well as the military for moving troops and material to the disputed Himalayan border. US-made C-130 transporters land in this patch. Harshil: An important town on the Himalayan pilgrimage route and also used by the military for operations. During the 2013 flash floods, the region was devastated and the town became an important logistical hub for troops to help with evacuation efforts. Gauchar: An important civil and military base about 100 kilometers southwest of Joshimath and just 200 kilometers from the border. The bulk of the Indian Air Force’s rescue and relief efforts in 2013 were staged from this town. Pithoragarh: It is an important military and civil hub. Apart from being a large administrative center, it has an airstrip that can accommodate large aircraft and is crucial to the military. Still, it’s difficult to accurately pinpoint the cause of damage in Joshimath in the absence of adequate scientific data, said Kalachand Sain, director of the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology in Uttarakhand’s Dehradun city. “The ecology of the region and the Himalayas is complex,” said Sain.“There are several places where there has been rapid development and construction but are holding. There is need for a thorough and extensive scientific study of the Himalayan region.”","A sinking town in the Himalayas, Joshimath, highlights the peril faced by the region due to extensive development, including dams and military installations near the China border.

Jury Awards Apple $250 Million in Design Patent Lawsuit Against Masimo,"In a significant legal victory, Apple has won a $250 million settlement in a design patent lawsuit against Masimo, a prominent medical technology company. The case, which revolved around Apple’s wearable technology and Masimo’s pulse oximetry devices, has captured the attention of the tech and healthcare industries alike. This decision, handed down by a jury, highlights the ongoing importance of intellectual property and design patents in the tech world. This monumental win not only underscores Apple’s commitment to protecting its innovations but also sets an important precedent for the tech and healthcare industries. It demonstrates that companies are willing to defend their designs vigorously, especially when they believe that another company has infringed on their intellectual property. Let’s dive deeper into the lawsuit, what the jury’s decision means for both companies, and the broader implications for the tech and healthcare sectors.","The Legal Battle and Apple’s Strategy Apple is no stranger to patent lawsuits, and this latest victory reinforces its strategy of fiercely defending its designs and intellectual property. Over the years, the company has built an empire on innovation, with the design of its products being one of its most significant assets. Apple’s legal team employed a robust defense strategy, focusing on the uniqueness of the Apple Watch’s design and the extent to which Masimo’s devices mirrored those features. For Apple, winning this lawsuit wasn’t just about monetary compensation—it was also about sending a clear message to the industry that it is willing to protect its designs at all costs. Design patents are incredibly important to tech companies, as they protect the look and feel of a product, preventing others from copying innovative ideas that could affect sales and market share. Apple’s success in this lawsuit reaffirms the importance of safeguarding intellectual property in an ever-evolving tech landscape. What Does the Verdict Mean for Masimo? For Masimo, the outcome of this trial is undeniably a setback. As a key player in the healthcare industry, Masimo has built its reputation on providing cutting-edge medical technology, such as non-invasive monitoring devices that measure blood oxygen levels. The jury’s decision, which found Masimo liable for infringing on Apple’s design patents, means that the company will likely face financial repercussions and potentially a reputational hit. While Masimo has been ordered to pay $250 million, the company may still appeal the decision, which could drag the case on for months or even years. Despite the potential for an appeal, the jury’s decision is a stark reminder that healthcare companies, like those in the tech sector, must take intellectual property seriously. The judgment could also have wider implications, making other companies in the medical technology field more cautious when developing products that may overlap with existing designs.",Opinion and Editorial,2024-12-10 00:00:00

Russia optimistic about MIG-35's victory in Indian Air Force tender,"MOSCOW: Russia on Thursday expressed optimism that the MiG-35 fighter jets fielded by it in the Indian Air Force's tender for acquisition of 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) will prove an edge over its Western rivals and ultimately win the contract. ""We hope that our aircraft would be the winner,"" chief of Rosoboronexport (ROE), Russia's sole state intermediary agency for export-import of defence-related technologies and services, Anatoly Isaikin said. ""Russia is competing with top aircraft manufacturers of the US and Europe. Such tenders are carried out in several stages and takes time. We are in the middle and so far, no one has dropped out,"" he said. Isaikin said MiG-35 is an air superiority fighter capable of taking on the current fourth and prospective fifth generation combat aircraft. ""From the point of view of technological inputs it is virtually a fifth generation fighter, unmatched by any of the European fighters,"" he said. ROE has fielded the MiG-35 fighter jets developed by RAC MiG against American rivals F-16 of Lockheed Martin and F/A-18 of Boeing, France's Rafale, Swedish JAS-39 Gripen (SAAB) and European Eurofighter Typhoon (EADS). ROE's exports in 2009 amounted to USD 7.4 billion of which over 50 per cent were related to fighter aircraft, Isaikin told a press conference here today. ""India, Algeria, China, Venezuela, Malaysia and Syria were among the major buyers of Russian fighters,"" he said. Under the Sukhoi deal, India is receiving kits and semi-knocked-down Su-30MKI multi-role fighter jets for assembly at HAL factories in the country. Last year, Russia also shipped four MiG-29K naval fighters for deployment on the INS Vikramaditya (Admiral Gorshkov), which is expected to join the Indian Navy after New Delhi and Moscow settle their dispute over the cost of modernisation of the Soviet-built aircraft carrier.","Russia is optimistic that its MiG-35 fighter jets will win the Indian Air Force's tender for 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA), competing against American and European manufacturers.

Supreme Court rejects 100% VVPAT-EVM verification: 'Need culture of trust',"Listen to Story The Supreme Court on Friday rejected all the petitions seeking the complete verification of votes cast using Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips. A two-judge bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta also rejected a demand to go back to ballot papers in elections. ""We rejected all pleas related to bringing ballot papers again."" Justice Khanna said at the hearing. The writ petitions were filed by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), Abhay Bhakchand Chhajed and Arun Kumar Aggarwal. During the hearing, the bench said that it gave the Election Commission of India (ECI) two directions. ""One direction is after the completion of the symbol loading process, the Symbol Loading Unit (SLU) should be sealed. The SLU should be stored at least for a period of 45 days,"" it said. ""The burnt memory in the microcontroller EVM shall be checked by a team of engineers after the declaration of results on a request by candidates in serial numbers 2 and 3. Such a request has to be made within seven days after the declaration of results."" Justice Khanna further asked the poll body to examine the suggestion for an electronic machine for vote counting the paper slips and whether along with the symbol there can be a bar code for each party. Justice Khanna said the ""expenses for the verification (of the program) to be borne by the candidates making the request, in case the EVM is found to be tampered, the expenses will be refunded"". ""Blindly distrusting a system can lead to unwarranted suspicions,"" Justice Datta said, adding, ""democracy is all about maintaining harmony and trust among all the pillars"". ""By nurturing a culture of trust and collaboration we can strengthen the voice of our democracy,"" he added. On April 18, the court had reserved its judgement on the petitionsafter a two-day hearing, and on Wednesday, itasked the ECI to provideclarification on five of its queriesregarding the functioning of EVMs. During the hearing on Wednesday, the bench asked the poll body to clarify if the microcontroller is installed in the controlling unit or in the VVPAT; is the microcontroller one-time programmable; the number of available Symbol Loading Units; data period storage; and whether the Control Unit is only sealed or is the VVPAT is kept separately. After a poll body official responded to the court's queries, the bench said, ""We cannot control the elections, we cannot control the functioning of another constitutional authority."" ""The ECI has cleared doubts. We cannot change your thought process. We cannot issue a mandamus on the basis of suspicion,"" it added. Presently, VVPAT verification is done only in five randomly selected EVMs in each Assembly segment of a parliamentary constituency. At all the EVM-VVPAT verification hearings, the ECI had maintained that the EVMs cannot be tampered with under any circumstances and that the complete counting of the VVPAT slips is not practically feasible. Earlier this month,the Supreme Court had issued a notice to the ECI on a petitionseeking the counting of all VVPAT paper slips in elections, instead of verifying only the five randomly selected EVMs. The petition challenged the Election Commission's guidelines that mandate that VVPAT verification shall be done sequentially, that is one after the other, thereby causing undue delay. It contended that if simultaneous verification was done and an additional number of officers were deployed for counting in each Assembly constituency, then complete VVPAT verification could be done in just five to six hours.- EndsPublished By:Karishma Saurabh KalitaPublished On:Apr 26, 2024Must Watch","Listen to Story The Supreme Court on Friday rejected all the petitions seeking the complete verification of votes cast using Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips.

Tea prices drop on higher supply in South India,"Higher supply of tea has put pressure on the market with prices in South India declining by nearly R20 per kg year-on-year. Further, lower prices of tea in Kenya have limited Indian CTC tea exports, leading to a glut in the market, traders said. The situation is alarming for many plantations in South India, which are operating on wafer-thin margin due to higher input and social costs. The situation is grim and similar to the one faced during 2004-05. With adequate amount of tea in the market and lower exports, there seems to be no scope of improvement in price in the short-term,? Chacko P Thomas, managing director, Kanan Devan Hills Plantation (KDHP) told FE. He said most of the plantations are facing a very serious crisis with production looking good. Market prices have dropped to R40-50 per kg for lower grade CTC tea from R65-75 per kg a year ago, N Sriram of Contemporary Tea Auctioneers said. ?Whenever tea production in South India increases, it has put pressure on the market because most of the production is CTC. Higher production of CTC tea in Kenya lowers Indian exports .Orthodox tea is faring better when compared to CTC,? he added. Tea Board data shows that total tea production during 2014 for the January-August period is higher by 10.76 mkg in South India ,while North India stands lower by 17.98 mkg when compared to the corresponding period of 2013.","The tea market in South India is facing significant challenges as oversupply has driven prices down by approximately ₹20 per kilogram compared to the previous year. Traders attribute this decline to reduced Indian CTC tea exports, impacted by lower prices of tea from Kenya. The surplus in the market has created a difficult situation for plantations in South India, particularly affecting those operating with narrow profit margins due to rising input and social costs. Chacko P Thomas, managing director of Kanan Devan Hills Plantation (KDHP), described the crisis as severe, resembling conditions seen in 2004-05, with little prospect of short-term price improvement despite adequate production levels. Market reports indicate that prices for lower-grade CTC tea have fallen to ₹40-50 per kg from ₹65-75 per kg a year ago. N Sriram from Contemporary Tea Auctioneers highlighted that increased CTC tea production in South India exacerbates market pressures, while orthodox tea varieties fare comparatively better. According to Tea Board data, South India's tea production from January to August 2014 has risen by 10.76 million kilograms, contrasting with a decrease of 17.98 million kilograms in North India during the same period compared to 2013.",National News,2014-10-31 00:00:00

Malala faces Pak backlash for questioning need to marry,"ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai's views on whether marriage is necessary for two people in a relationship has invited an avalanche of criticism in Pakistan, where she has long gained a reputation as controversy's favourite child with her outspokenness.In an interview published in the British Vogue magazine, Malala responded to a question on the institution of marriage by wondering why a relationship could not be just a ""partnership"".""Thinking about relationships, you know, on social media, everyone’s sharing their relationship stories, and you get worried…if you can trust someone or not, and how can you be sure,"" she said.

Bypoll notification by Sept-end likely,"The commencement of first-level checking of EVMS and VVPATS at the Nalgonda headquarters, on the instructions of the Election Commission of India, has fuelled speculation that a notification for the Munugode bypoll may be issued by the monthend and subsequently, polling will be held in October-end or early November. The checks started on Wednesday and are expected to last a week, following which Nalgonda district collector T. Vinay Krishna Reddy, also the district election officer, will submit a report to the ECI on the readiness of the district administration for the bypoll. Besides the initiation of checks, additional EVMS and VVPATS were also transferred from Bhongir district to Nalgonda, after officials estimated that the machinery would be insufficient for the poll. As many as 1,192 ballot units, 596 control units and 596 VVPATS are currently at the disposal of the Nalgonda district administration. Further, official sources indicated that EVMS and VVPATS would be kept at 200 per cent of the estimated requirement, as a precautionary measure. Munugode Assembly constituency has seven mandals, two municipalities and 176 gram panchayats, with 288 polling stations in all. As the constituency has been witnessing an increase in polling since 2014 — when it recorded 85 per cent voter turnout, followed by 91 per cent voter turnout in 2018 — there is an expectation that the turnout may cross the 95 per cent mark this time around. Sources said that the randomisation of EVMS and VVPATS will be done, in the presence of officials and political representatives, once the notification is issued. A second round of randomisation will also be done before shifting them to polling stations. With the TRS, BJP and Congress in a three-way battle for the seat, many Munugode natives who have settled in other districts and states have also enrolled as voters, with around 15,000 applications filed over the past month.","The Election Commission of India has initiated first-level checks of EVMS and VVPATS at Nalgonda headquarters, leading to speculation about an imminent notification for the Munugode bypoll.

Recently repaired Itanagar-Hollongi NH develops cracks,"A large portion of the Itanagar-Hollongi national highway (NH), which had been repaired just before the nationwide lockdown was imposed, has developed major cracks following sporadic rainfall in the past few weeks. This stretch of the highway had eroded a few months earlier and had been filled up by the Itanagar highway division, but it has developed cracks, making it dangerous for vehicles to ply on it. Speaking to this daily, Itanagar Highway Division Executive Engineer Nani Tath informed: “When the road was falling apart, a hill had to be cut down to fill it. We could not do anything to the hill as it requires natural settlement. We water it, so that settlement takes place, and then we go for casting, and the filling of the road was done without proper compaction due to the deep gorge.” The road “has now been left as it is intentionally for the rainwater to percolate down to create natural compaction and settlement, and a 30- to 40-metre side drain will be connected to it,” he said. Informing that repair work is likely to begin by Wednesday, the EE said “enough percolation must have taken place by now, and I have directed the contractor to connect the drain, so that the new work does not get affected.” Tath informed that the contractor is yet to get paid for all the work done so far, due to non-sanctioning of fund against the damages, but has assured to continue the work on request. “We have submitted the estimate to the ministry of road transport & highways, which is under consideration as the same was also inspected by union MoS for Road Transport & Highways, VK Singh, the last time he visited. “The minister had instructed the ministry’s regional officer that he would sanction the fund, and had asked us to go ahead with the work. We have carried out the work at his direction,” the EE said. Officials from the union road transport & highways ministry’s Itanagar regional office (Camp Tezpur) had inspected the damages on 2 August, 2019, and the minister had also seen the damages during his maiden visit to the state capital on 28 August, 2019.","Following sporadic rainfall, a repaired portion of the Itanagar-Hollongi national highway (NH) has developed major cracks, rendering it dangerous for vehicles.

"Take Turkish bath to heal paralysis , obesity","Hyderabad: Whenever someone mentions Masjid Miyan Mishk, one is reminded of the Garam Hamam (hot bath) there. Many think it was razed, but the fact is that it exists in a better condition and can be used after minor repairs. The masjid was built by Miyan Mishk, a noble in the court of Sultan Abdullah Qutub Shah, seventh ruler of the Qutb Sahi dynasty in the 16th century. The Masjid stands on a corner of Purana Pul. Garam Hamam is located inside the Masjid, behind a small graveyard to the right side, where a family whose ancestors were brought from Delhi to manage the Hamam lives. Managing committee president Samad Warsi said the hot bath was in good condition. “We are maintaining it, but no one is able to manage it according to ancient methods,” he said. Garam Hamam, also known as “Turkish bath” is a therapeutic method of cleansing and relaxation using hot water and steam. Turkish baths followed a 3-step process. There’s a sauna and steam bath and then a full body wash, often finished with a massage. Sweating during the hot bath can have caloric burning equivalent to running. Although the Turkish bath employed the same kind of heating system as the earlier Roman one, it is different in many ways. The Turkish bath consists of three sections: the cool room, the tepidity room, and the hottest room. Garam Hamam here consists of five chambers. The first two chambers are for initial exercise and changing and there are three treatment rooms. The last chamber is the main chamber where a person is treated to hot and steam bath and massages. In a separate chamber, quintals of firewood burn to boil the water and create steam. There are 3 basins to store water. A man has to spend half an hour in the hottest chamber, depending on his body’s resistance. He then shifts to the tepidity room, which is less hot, and then to the cool room where his body temperature is maintained and gradually brought down to room temperature. Heat makes the blood flow better and can relax muscles. Adding Epsom salt to a hot tub can also reduce inflammation of joints caused by arthritis or other musculo-skeletal disorders. Also, the anti-inflammatory property of salt baths has a positive effect on those suffering from metabolic diseases such as Type II diabetes. Dr Anjum Sultana, a Unani doctor, says steam baths are useful in reducing sinus pain, nasal congestion and severe cough. Nasal congestion is caused because of inflammation in nasal airways and the vapour causes the blood vessels of the face and nose to move, hence nasal secretions relax and dilate. Hot water bath helps the body’s immune system fight viruses better. She said very hot water can make the skin more sensitive, but hot water baths with extracts like coconut oil, olive oil or lavender extract as well as oatmeal can hydrate the skin and heal dryness and sensitivity. She said one should take this kind of bath under an expert who monitors not only temperature of the chamber but also checks its impact on the body. It is useful in healing paralysis, obesity and bad cholesterol.",Sweating during hot bath can have caloric burning to that of running.,Weather,2019-01-14 00:00:00

"Apple's iMac 21.5"" and 27"" : It's a pleasure","The iMac is Apple’s line of “all-in-one” desktop computers where the entire unit essentially comprises a display with all computing components built into the rear of the monitor. The iMacs come in two screen sizes—21.5” and 27” (length of the screen along the diagonal)—and we’ve tested a demo unit of each size. Legend has it that Apple founder Steve Jobs wears only polo-neck sweaters because he believes that buttons are a design flaw. That philosophy is certainly incorporated in these machines as both of us were a bit puzzled while trying to turn the machines on, until we finally located the (non-protruding) power button at the bottom left corner of the machine’s rear. The bottom right side on the rear has four USB ports, a firewire port, a ‘display out’ port, an ethernet port and microphone and headphone jacks. We didn’t really end up using the last three since the iMacs have built-in Wifi, microphone and excellent stereo speakers. There’s a tiny webcam lens just above the screen and an optical drive and memory card reader on the right side. But the real stand-out features of these machines are the gorgeous LEDbacklit screens which produce far superior colours, contrasts and viewing angles to any monitors we’ve seen before. While the 21.5” version has an impressive 1920x1080 pixel resolution, it looks absolutely pedestrian when compared to the stunning 2560x1440 resolution of its big brother. In fact, the latter’s screen size and sharpness is almost a disadvantage since one often struggled to move the mouse cursor from one end of the screen to another in one single arm motion. The 27” edition was beset with display problems at the time of its launch in the US but the piece that we tested held up without a problem for the 2-month testing period. Although both machines come with 4GB of RAM with expansion slots for upto 16 GB, there are a couple of hardware mix and match options for each iMac. The entry level models run on Intel’s Core 2 Duo 3.06 GHz processors but the 27” version can be purchased with the powerful new Intel i7 quad-core processors, allowing it to be used for industrial level movie editing, for instance. One also has a choice of graphic cards and hard disk sizes (ranging from 500 MB to 2 TB) depending on usage needs. Both models run Apple’s latest operating system version 10.6, dubbed ‘Snow Leopard’, which is more of an upgrade to the ‘Tiger’ (10.5) version rather than an entirely new OS. The bundled wireless keyboard has lost all its weight and is razor thin. While it is sturdy, the keys are much smaller and are more suitable for typing rather than professional video editing. The one we got with the 27” version seemed to wobble a bit during high-speed typing. The new Magic Mouse, which has no buttons but mimmicks the gesture control found on all the new large touchpads of the MacBook laptops is a joy to work with, though it might require some getting used to sans scrolling and clicking. Starting at Rs 65,000 and Rs 90,000 respectively for the 21.5” and 27” models with the latter going up to well over a lakh for the souped-up configurations, the iMac is by no means an affordable computer. However, if price is no constraint, then there is probably no better desktop computer available in the market in terms of looks, design, specifications and the sheer joy of using a beautifully engineered machine.","The article provides an in-depth review of Apple's iMac desktop computers, covering both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch models. Key points: The iMac features an ""all-in-one"" design with the entire computing components integrated into the rear of the display. The standout feature is the stunning LED-backlit display, offering impressive resolutions of 1920x1080 (21.5-inch) and 2560x1440 (27-inch). The 27-inch model can be configured with powerful Intel i7 quad-core processors, making it suitable for professional tasks like video editing. Other hardware options include RAM, storage, and graphics card choices to suit different user needs. The wireless keyboard and Magic Mouse provide a clean, minimalist input experience, though the keyboard may not be ideal for intensive typing. Starting at Rs 65,000 and Rs 90,000 respectively, the iMac is a premium offering, but its excellent design, specifications, and user experience justify the high price for those who can afford it.

Alarming rise in unemployment rates in Asia and the Pacific,"As per the recent report of ILO Global Employment Trends for Youth 2022: Asia and the Pacific, the unemployment rate of young people aged between 15 and 24 years in Asia and the Pacific is estimated to have reached 14.9 per cent in 2022, which is the same as the global average. While that rate represents a decrease from the rate of the previous year (15.5 per cent), it remains higher than the pre-pandemic benchmark of 13.3 per cent in 2019. Beyond the regional aggregate, there are important divergences between sub-regions and countries in the evolution of unemployment rates and other labour market indicators. In both Southern and Eastern Asia, youth unemployment rates in 2022 are projected to be higher than the pre-pandemic benchmark by less than 1 percentage point, whereas in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, the corresponding rate is projected to be higher by 2 percentage points. In Sri Lanka, which is currently experiencing balance of payments and sovereign debt crises, youth unemployment in the second quarter of 2021 was at 30.0 per cent, whereas in Vietnam, which is benefiting from diversification strategies of global value chains as COVID-19 lockdowns in China persist, the corresponding rate for the same quarter was 5.5. per cent. Young men in the region face substantially higher unemployment rates (16.0 per cent) than young women (12.7 per cent). However, when examining a more comprehensive measure of labour underutilization, that is, the combined rate of youth unemployment and potential labour force (termed the LU3 rate), the gap between men and women diminishes, pointing to young women having higher potential labour force rates than young men.","As per the recent report of ILO Global Employment Trends for Youth 2022: Asia and the Pacific, the unemployment rate of young people aged between 15 and 24 years in Asia and the Pacific is estimated to have reached 14.9 per cent in 2022, which is the same as the global average.

"Meta unveils AI tool that can generate, edit videos based on text prompts","By Kurt Wagner Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. debuted a new artificial intelligence tool that can generate or edit videos based on a simple text prompt, elevating competition with rivals like OpenAI and Google in the race to develop the world’s most advanced AI technology. Meta’s product, Movie Gen, can create a new video up to 16 seconds long based on a text prompt. It can also use such prompts to generate audio for or edit an existing video, or even use a photo to create a customized video featuring a real person. Movie Gen is only available for some internal employees and a handful of outside partners, including some filmmakers, though the social media company — which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger — plans to build the product into its existing apps sometime next year. Executives are still discussing how best to implement this integration, but the aim is for Movie Gen to encourage more people to create or edit video posts, said Connor Hayes, a Meta vice president focused on generative AI products. It will be “fun to use, helpful for creators, good for overall engagement in the apps, but we don’t have a concrete product plan of what it will look like at this point,” he said. The social networking leader is one of many major tech companies pushing into AI models focused on generating videos, which are more complicated and expensive to build than those that return AI-generated text. Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI has its own video generation tool, called Sora, that debuted earlier this year and can create videos up to a minute in length, though that technology isn’t available to the public yet. DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, also has a video generation tool, called Veo, which was unveiled earlier this year Meta is waiting to roll out Movie Gen for several reasons, including the technology’s efficiency. It currently takes “tens of minutes” to generate a video based on a text prompt — too long for general consumers, who are likely to use this on their phone, Hayes said. But Meta is also “sorting out a bunch of really important problems around safety and responsibility,” Hayes said, including how to handle personalized videos so that a user can’t create an inappropriate or unflattering video featuring another person without their consent. “That’s going to be probably the most important problem to solve before we would make the personalization capability available to folks broadly.”This type of technology has been used in the past to create misleading so-called deepfakes of famous people, including US President Joe Biden and pop star Taylor Swift, though Meta executives have said they’re working on ways to “watermark” these creations so that people can tell they’re AI-generated. Meta has made AI advancements a key priority for the entire company, and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly talked about AI as a driver of user and revenue growth. In the short term, Zuckerberg has credited AI for helping improve the company’s content algorithms by showing people more relevant posts and advertisements. Eventually, Zuckerberg has said he believes AI will play an even larger role in powering its apps and other futuristic wearables Meta is producing, like smart glasses.","Meta Platforms Inc. has introduced Movie Gen, an AI tool capable of generating or editing videos based on text prompts, enhancing competition with companies like OpenAI and Google.

Meta aims to integrate this tool into its apps next year, focusing on safety and ethical concerns, particularly regarding user consent in personalized videos.

WATCH | Bihar cop made to do sit-ups for stopping agriculture officer's vehicle during lockdown,"ARARIA: A policeman was forced to do 50 sit-ups here by a senior agriculture officer after he stopped the bureaucrat's vehicle and asked him to show the mandatory pass for moving during the coronavirus lockdown, in yet another instance of front-line workers facing harassment. Bihar Director General of Police (DGP) Gupteshwar Pandey on Tuesday took strong note of the incident and asserted that action will be taken after a probe report is submitted. The incident, whose video has gone viral on the social media, occurred near Surajpur pul (bridge) under Jokihat police station area on Monday when chowkidar Ganesh Lal Tatma halted the vehicle of District Agriculture Officer Manoj Kumar and asked for the pass needed to move around during the lockdown imposed in the wake of coronavirus pandemic. This riled the officer who, after severely scolding the chowkidar, forced him to do 50 sit-ups while holding his ears. The agriculture officer did not stop at this and threatened that he could have sent Tatma to jail had he not been in a hurry to attend a video conference. A police officer, who was heard in the video posing as incharge, also upbraided Tatma for ""letting him down"" in front of the senior officer. ""You have made me feel insulted in front of the senior officer,"" the police officer was heard yelling at the chowkidar. Pandey said he talked to Inspector General of Police and Superintendent of Police of Araria over the unpleasant incident. He disapproved of the conduct of the officials, saying they insulted the chowkidar who as part of the administration was playing an important role in enforcing the lockdown. It is very shameful and against human dignity, Pandey said. Superintendent of Police Dhurat Sayali has ordered a probe into the incident.

Proposal to set up IT centre,"DANAPUR: The Railway has proposed setting up an information technology (IT) centre of the East Central Railway (ECR) at Patna. It has become a must keeping in view sudden increase in the number of computerised reservation offices under ECR. According to an ECR official, the new IT centre is likely to be equipped with all modern facilities which will cater to the needs of five divisions under ECR. This centre, which will incur an expenditure up to Rs 1 crore, will certainly lessen the present load on the main computer centres of Delhi and Kolkata, he said. The computerised reservation offices of the three divisions Danapur, Mughalsarai and Dhanbad are at present linked with Kolkata computer centre while Sonepur and Samastipur are linked with the Delhi centre. Thus, the setting up of a new IT centre is essential to run all the computerised reservation offices of these five divisions smoothly in the larger interest of passengers, an ECR official said. Indian Railways have five such centres in the country located at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Secunderabad. The proposed centre at Patna will be the sixth prestigious one of the railways. According to sources, railways have already developed their own 'centre for railway information system' (CRIS) at the country level. Linking all computerised reservation offices of the ECR with the CRIS will prove to be more successful. Like the 'servo' of unreserved ticketing system (UTS), railways intend to make a special 'servo' for the computerised reservation centres also, sources said adding that railways could save a huge amount being given to BSNL now for supplying link to railway computerised reservation offices. The sources said railways have also developed their own 'network' at the global level connecting it to satellite service. It is mainly due to this facility that railway network is spreading in every nook and corner of the country to provide more passengers amenities. The 'UTS' facility at Patna is one of them, sources said adding that the Karbhighaiya end of Patna Junction will be developed as the IT centre of ECR keeping in view the fact that 'UTS' and the 'call centre' facilities have been put up there only. Meanwhile, railways have approved the plan to provide 'UTS' facilities at 28 more stations under ECR. The Danapur division is having this facility at 22 stations. Under the 'UTS' facility, one can purchase tickets three days in advance for any station falling within the jurisdiction of ECR, sources said.","The Indian Railways plans to establish an Information Technology (IT) center for the East Central Railway (ECR) in Patna due to the rising number of computerized reservation offices.

"Thought H-1B workers had made it? Turns out Google, Microsoft, other tech firms pay them below par","A majority of the US H-1B employers, including tech giants like Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft, use the temporary work visa programme to pay the migrant workers well below market wages, a new report has claimed. The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers from countries like India and China in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Nearly 500,000 migrant workers are employed in the US in the H-1B status. ""Among the top 30 H-1B employers are major US firms including Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, Google, Apple and Facebook. All of them take advantage of program rules in order to legally pay many of their H-1B workers below the local median wage for the jobs they fill,"" said the report released by the Economic Policy Institute. Authored by Daniel Costa and Ron Hira, the report titled ""H-1B visas and prevailing wage levels"" says 60 per cent of H-1B positions certified by the US Department of Labor (DOL) are assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation. While the H-1B programme rules allow this, the DOL has the authority to change it, but has not, it said. While over 53,000 employers used the H-1B programme in 2019, the top 30 H-1B employers accounted for more than one in four of all 389,000 H-1B petitions approved by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2019, it said. Half of the top 30 H-1B employers use an outsourcing business model to provide staff for third-party clients, rather than employing H-1B workers directly to fill a special need at the company that applies for the visa, the report said. The report alleged that major US-based technology firms that hire H-1B workers directly, rather than contract them out to third-party employers, had significant shares of their certified H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2, the two lowest wage levels in fiscal 2019, both of which are below the local median wage. ""Until now, much of the public discourse and proposals for reforming H-1B have focused on rules that would constrain the practices of these outsourcing companies,"" the report said. But researches reveal that many firms that employ H-1B workers directly, including some of the biggest names in the technology industry such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Qualcomm, Salesforce and Uber, pay a large share of their H-1B workers at one of the two lowest wage levels, Level 1 or Level 2. In addition, these direct-hire firms also hire many H-1B workers on a contract basis through outsourcing firms, it added. Microsoft, the seventh-largest H-1B employer in 2019, assigned one-third (35 per cent) of its positions on Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) as Level 1 and two-fifths (42 per cent) as Level 2. In total, Microsoft assigned more than three-quarters (77 per cent) of its H-1B positions as Level 1 or Level 2, a wage level below the local median wage. Microsoft assigned only 18 per cent of its positions as Level 3 (the median) wage, and a mere three per cent as Level 4, the only above-median wage level. Amazon, which appears twice in the H-1B top 30, as ""Amazon.com Services"" (no. 4 among the biggest H-1B employers) and ""Amazon Web Services"" (no. 27), also assigned the vast majority of its H-1B positions at one of the two lowest wage levels. According to the report, Amazon.com Services assigned 34 per cent of its H-1B positions as Level 1 and 51 per cent as Level 2, for a total of 86 per cent of all positions certified. Amazon Web Services assigned 47 per cent of its H-1B workers as Level 1 and 36 per cent as Level 2. Combined, Amazon.com Services and Amazon Web Services had 12,428 positions certified at Level 1 or 2, for a total of 85 per cent certified at a wage level below the median. Only one in eight (1,684) were certified at or above the 50th percentile (Level 3 or Level 4), it said. Apple, eleventh on the list, assigned 558 of its H-1B positions (two per cent) as Level 1 and one-third (32 per cent) as Level 2, for a combined total of 34 per cent at Levels 1 and 2. Apple assigned 32 per cent as Level 3 and 34 per cent as Level 4. Google, ranked the fifth-largest H-1B employer, had 9,085 H-1B positions certified by the DOL in fiscal 2019. It assigned less than half of one per cent of its certified H-1B jobs as Level 1 and 54 per cent as Level 2. Only 37 per cent of Google's jobs were certified at or above the median wage, the report said. Facebook assigned only one position as Level 1 and 10 per cent of its 6,118 total H-1B positions as Level 2. Twenty-five per cent were certified at Level 3 and 16 per cent at Level 4. Nearly half (49 per cent) of Facebook's H-1B positions were certified at a wage established by an alternative wage survey, making it difficult to assess its H-1B wage distribution, it said. Uber, the 29th-ranked H-1B employer in 2019, had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by the DOL. Less than one per cent was assigned as Level 1 and just over half (53 per cent) as Level 2. Just over one-third were assigned as Level 3 and 13 per cent as Level 4. While Uber had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by DOL and hired 1,160 H-1B workers in 2019, in the same year, it made headlines by laying off 400 employees. The report claims that the top 30 H-1B employers are in fact hiring H-1B workers to fill a very large number of routine (Levels 1 and 2) positions that require relatively little experience and ordinary skills.","A report by the Economic Policy Institute claims that major US tech firms like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple exploit H-1B visa rules to pay foreign workers below local median wages. The report indicates that 60% of H-1B positions are assigned low wage levels, with top employers using this program for routine jobs requiring minimal experience. The Department of Labor has the authority to change these rules but has not. The report highlights that even direct-hire firms and those using outsourcing models pay many H-1B workers at the two lowest wage levels.",International News,2019-05-06 00:00:00
Former MLA moves HC over refusal to permit azan,"Former Aligarh MLA Zameerullah Khan has approached the Allahabad High Court over Hathras District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Lakxar’s refusal to allow azan, the Muslim call to ritual prayer, in local mosques. “The District Magistrate is misusing his powers. Some Hathras residents approached me for support. When we didn’t get any response from higher officials of the Aligarh zone, we approached the Allahabad High Court and our appeal has been admitted. It has been merged with the PIL of Ghazipur MP Afzal Ansari as the DM of Ghazipur had also passed a similar oral order,” he said. On Tuesday, the Bench of Justice Shashi Kant Gupta and Justice Ajit Kumar heard the arguments through videoconferencing and reserved judgment. Local social worker and former municipal councillor Raees Abbasi told The Hindu that he, along with locals, met the DM many times and told him that azan would not lead to any violation of lockdown but he refused to listen. “Azan is given by the muezzin and it doesn’t take more than 90 seconds. We told him that nobody would rush to the mosque after azan,” he said. He asked if there was an order from Lucknow, how was azan still being allowed in neighbouring districts of Aligarh, Mathura and Agra. “Azan helps the faithful during Ramzan as they get to know the sehri and iftar time [meals before daybreak and after sunset],” he added. Mr. Laxhar declined to comment on the case saying it was sub judice, but pointed out that azan was not being allowed in Ghazipur and Farrukhabad as well. “I don’t buy the argument that if neighbouring districts were allowing it, we should allow. On March 26, it was mutually agreed upon that no religious activity would take place in temples and mosques,” he claimed. When asked whether he was confusing between azan and namaz and if he had an order from the State government, he refused to comment and insisted on waiting for the High Court order.","Former Aligarh MLA Zameerullah Khan has approached the Allahabad High Court regarding the Hathras District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxar's refusal to allow the Muslim call to prayer, azan, in local mosques. Khan alleges misuse of power and, along with local residents, contends that azan wouldn't violate lockdown rules. The case, merged with a PIL by Ghazipur MP Afzal Ansari, awaits judgment. Social worker Raees Abbasi argues that azan, lasting 90 seconds, poses no threat and questions discrepancies with neighboring districts. Laxar, refusing to comment on the case, defends the ban citing a mutual agreement on religious activity suspension since March 26.",Local News,2020-05-05 00:00:00

"Need strategic planting of saplings, not just seed bombing for greener results: Experts","Panaji: The state has seen a plantation spree with students, teachers, and others planting seedlings and saplings. Tree lovers are drawing inspiration either from the monsoon greenery or the series of uprootings to plant more. Social media is abuzz with planting and seed bombing. But botanists and horticulturists have a few words of advice regarding the same. “The pits should be of sufficient size, according to the types of trees. A small pit would be okay for a small bag (seedling). It also depends on the soil; the softer the soil, the better the chances of survival,” said Sandeep Azrencar, an environmentalist. Thousands of saplings are planted, but the question remains—how many saplings will survive? Experts say several things must be kept in mind. Starting with the planting spot in terms of the right soil and the location. Another factor is the initial care and protection of the plant. The forest department that supplies lakhs of saplings for planting has two options of providing saplings—in big or small bags. “For them, it is uneconomical to use seedlings in big bags,” Azrencar said. The planting depends on the types of trees. “There are hardy varieties like gotting, tamarind, or satonn, which grow in open space. But zambul needs shade and watering initially,” he further said. Seed bombing is becoming popular, but some are wary about it. “It is a total no-no for city areas as the seeds will not take root,” says Daniel D’Souza, a landscape designer. The option is suitable for barren land and forest areas, Azrencar said. The quality of planting material and soil conditions are key factors for the survival of planted material. “Hence, if more saplings are planted, many may survive,” a forest department official said.","In Panaji, there's a growing trend of tree planting driven by monsoon greenery and recent deforestation. Social media is abuzz with planting and seed bombing, but experts stress proper techniques for success. Key factors include using appropriately sized planting pits, ensuring soil quality, and providing initial care. The forest department offers saplings in various bag sizes, with larger bags being more economical. Hardy tree species can grow in open areas, while others need shade and watering. Seed bombing is best suited for barren or forested areas, not urban environments. Proper planting practices increase the likelihood of sapling survival.",Environment,2024-07-30 00:00:00
Tata plant will spur growth in Bengal',"NEW DELHI: Undaunted by the opposition to acquisition of agricultural land at Singur for Tata's automobile plant that would produce the Nano, the West Bengal government has told the Supreme Court that the Singur venture would lead to rapid industrialisation of the state. ""The state government thinks that the implementation of the project at Singur will play a pivotal role with regard to developments in the field of modern industry in all respects not only in Singur, but also throughout the state of West Bengal,"" the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government said.The state was responding to the SC's notice to it on a petition filed by the Karnataka Landless Farmers Association, which was complaining against the states' recent policy to increasingly target agricultural land for setting up industries and SEZs. The West Bengal government refuted allegations that 645.67 acres of land had been leased out to Tatas at throwaway prices and said: ""The government has the power to form any policy and/or to exempt from paying various claims for the sake of greater interest of the state."" The association had alleged that soon 43,000 more acres of land would be acquired for two dozen companies of an available 2.25 lakh arable and arid land. Rejecting this, the state said: ""Though a few thousand acres of lands are under examination for setting up industrial units in different districts, out of which a major portion of land is not fit for cultivation or not at all fertile.""","Summary: West Bengal government defends the acquisition of agricultural land at Singur for Tata's automobile plant, arguing it will lead to rapid industrialization.

Kavlekar scotches rumours on offer from MGP,"MARGAO: Congress MLA Chandrakant (Babu) Kavlekar on Friday scotched the romours that he has been approached by MGP leaders to join that political party to contest the 2017 assembly elections. Speaking to ‘The Navhind Times’ on the sidelines of a Seva Dal programme at Fatorpa in Quepem taluka, Kavlekar brushed aside the reports which said that MGP leaders approached him to join their party, saying “I am with the Congress very much.’’ When all Congress leaders reached the venue of the Seva Dal programme Kavlekar had not been spotted, making the leaders suspicious about Kavlekar’s movements. “I was supposed to go to Malaysia. But I cancelled the trip to end the rumours. Had I been absent they would have reasons to believe the falsity as truth,’’ he said. Kavlekar, however, said that he was hurt by the remarks of some Congress leaders. “I was hurt by the politics a few of these leaders wanted to play. But I did not think of leaving the party.

Sony Xperia XZ2 Vs Xperia XZ1: What new upgrades has Sony packed in its new flagship?,"Design Sony launched its new flagship smartphones, the Xperia XZ2 and Xperia XZ2 Compact at Mobile World Congress 2018. For over half a decade Sony remained consistent with its omnibalance/loop design philosophy. However, the Japanese tech company long stuck in the past, has finally arrived in the present. The boxy-design has finally been left in the lurch. The flagship Xperia XZ2 comes with an entirely modern design, powerful innards and a few striking features. Let’s take a look at what changes Sony has made to its new Xperia model over its predecessor. Design One of the biggest upgrades on the new Sony Xperia XZ phone is its design. The squared-off edgy design with thick bezels is now replaced with what Sony calls ‘Ambient Flow.’ The Xperia XZ2 features rather curved edges with slightly tapered back. The rear side is glossy, and it appears to be quite similar to the HTC flagship, HTC U11. Compared to the Xperia XZ1, the side bezels on the successor are reduced to an extent. However, the top and bottom part are still chunky to accommodate front-firing speaker grills. Both Xperia XZ1 and the XZ2 have aluminium core grilled between glass panels. But the latter now boasts of a 3D Gorilla Glass 5 sheath and the slight curvature seems to promise a better grip on the phone. The fingerprint sensor that was earlier embedded on the power button itself on the Xperia XZ1 has been repositioned to the back on the new flagship below the camera module. Further, the rear camera now sits at the centre instead of the top left corner as we’ve seen on the Xperia XZ1. There is no headphone jack on the Xperia XZ2 and you will have to compromise with the USB Type-C port (quite hapless). Overall, the design on the Xperia XZ2 looks to be up-to-the-minute and Sony has finally started taking a reasonable approach and renounced its long-standing ‘omnibalance’ tradition. Besides cutting the squared edges and slimming down the bezels, Sony has stretched the aspect ratio as well on the new Xperia XZ2. The flagship features a 5.7-inch full HD+ (HDR TRILUMINOS) display with 18:9 aspect ratio. It has 2160 x 1080 pixels stretched across the front panel. The Xperia XZ1 meanwhile offered a 5.2-inch full HD display with 16:9 aspect ratio. The XZ1’s successor still holds the LCD panel. However, unlike its predecessor, the Xperia XZ2 doesn’t just support HDR content but the video content is converted to HDR using an upscale algorithm. The new flagship has a similar footprint like the XZ1, but you you get more screen real estate to view and enjoy the content. The Sony Xperia XZ2 features a 5.7-inch FHD+ 18:9 display, meanwhile, the XZ1 has a 5.2-inch FHD 16:9 displayThe Sony Xperia XZ2 features a 5.7-inch FHD+ 18:9 display, meanwhile, the XZ1 has a 5.2-inch FHD 16:9 display Camera Sony really puts good emphasis on the imaging segment and the company has given similar treatment to its new premium smartphone. The Xperia XZ2 features a 19-megapixel memory-stacked Motion Eye sensor. Notably, the XZ1 had the same 19MP unit, however, its successor now packs a few compelling pieces under its camera shade. If you remember, the Sony Xperia XZs and the XZ Premium were the first to offer slow-mo footage @960fps in 720p. Sony yet again pushing the boundaries has now introduced 4K HDR video capture on its new Xperia XZ2. Further, it has bumped up the slow-mo resolution as well from 720p to 1080p. And like we mentioned, the XZ2 now has the ability to upscale video streamed into HDR. Coming to the front camera, Sony has significantly reduced the front camera pixel count from 13MP (Xperia XZ1) to a 5MP sensor on the Xperia XZ2. The front camera on the phone has 23mm wide-angle lens with f/2.2 aperture instead of a 22mm wide angle lens (f/2.0 aperture) found on the Xperia XZ1. Sony introduced 3D imaging feature on its previous XZ iteration that allowed users to create a 3D character of objects by using the rear camera. The feature is now enabled on the front-facing camera to have fun creating 3D selfies on the new Xperia XZ2. Processing hardware & battery The Sony Xperia XZ2 is powered by Qualcomm’s premium mobile platform, Snapdragon 845. The Xperia XZ1 meanwhile was shipped with Qualcomm’s previous flagship SoC, Snapdragon 835. Like its predecessor, the XZ2 packs 4GB of RAM and 64GB inbuilt storage. But this time around, Sony in collaboration with Qualcomm has built an image signal processor designed precisely for the camera on the Xperia XZ2. This means, that the phone is now expected to provide enhanced low-light photography and better colour reproduction. The phone has an expandable storage support of up to 400GB using microSD card. It supports LTE Cat 18 that offer download speed of up to 1.2Gbps. As for the powerhouse, the Sony Xperia XZ2 carries a slightly bigger 3180mAh battery. The Xperia XZ1 packed a 2700mAh battery. Another notable aspect on the XZ2 is its wireless charging support which was missing on the previous iteration. OS and Other changes A few other worthy upgrades in the new Sony Xperia XZ2 being its reactive vibration motor which is revamped to react with media- music, movies etc. For this Sony has put an additional ‘slider’ in the volume menu that lets you adjust the haptics accordingly. The Xperia XZ2 is claimed to offer 20 percent louder sound output compared to the XZ1 and with the Dynamic Vibration system, it will be able to add vibration to videos that you stream or even while playing games. Further, the dual front-facing speakers are now paired with the internal DAC that now supports for high-res audio codec. On the software front, the XZ2 runs the latest Google Android OS, Android Oreo with the proprietary Sony UI on top. The Sony Xperia XZ1 was launched with Android Oreo as well. So, we believe the experience on this part will be more or less the same. Bottom line, Sony was in a dire need to change the design language of its smartphones, and we can clearly see that the Japanese tech company has finally put ears to its users’ request that was long overdue. The Sony Xperia XZ2 carries a design and a tall 18:9 display which is more in line with the current trends. The device’s capability to capture 4K HDR video (rear camera) and 3D selfies with the front-facing camera could be a point worth considering when buying the XZ2. Additionally, the smartphone now comes with Qi wireless charging support. A smaller-res front camera could be a bit of a let down for selfie-lovers but it doesn’t seem like a deal-breaker for a device with major overhaul in terms of design, latest hardware (Snapdragon 845), bigger battery and a tall display.","Sony’s Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact mark a major design shift from the company’s old omnibalance style to a modern ""Ambient Flow"" design with curved edges and reduced bezels. The Xperia XZ2 features a 5.7-inch FHD+ 18:9 display, Snapdragon 845 chipset, 4GB RAM, and 64GB storage. Its 19MP Motion Eye rear camera now supports 4K HDR video and 1080p slow-motion, while the front camera drops to 5MP but adds 3D selfie support. Other upgrades include a 3180mAh battery, wireless charging, louder dual speakers, and Android Oreo. Overall, the XZ2 offers a significant improvement in design, performance, and multimedia features.",Technology and Gadgets,2018-03-03 00:00:00

"Rupee falls below 70, recovers","Mumbai: The rupee breached the psychological barrier of 70 to the dollar on Tuesday but quickly turned around on the back of RBI support and recovery in the Turkish lira, which had been responsible for the turmoil in the currency market The Indian currency opened at 69.85, a tad higher over Monday s close of 69.93, rose to an intra-day high of 69.69 and slipped to 70.08 in morning trade. But thereafter it recovered fast as the central bank stepped in and closed at 69.90, a gain of 3 paise over Monday s close The rupee is the worst performing currency in Asia as it has fallen over 9 per cent this calendar year. August has marked the largest depreciation of the rupee against the dollar in the past year According to B. Prasanna, group executive and head (global markets group) of ICICI Bank, the domestic currency was the victim of the contagion effect impacting all emerging markets triggered by the Turkish crisis He added that the gradual pace of depreciation in the rupee till the 69-levels was because of the sharp rise in current account deficit from 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2016-17 to an estimated 2.5 per cent of GDP this year mainly due to surging oil prices. CAD is the difference between foreign exchange earned and spent. Experts, however, remain divided over the course the rupee. While a section believes the impact of the current crisis will be limited as domestic factors such as lower retail inflation numbers (which ease concerns about a rate hike) and stabilising FPI flows will provide support to the rupee, there are others who are of the view that firm crude prices will play a spoilsport It is also feared that with developed economies unwinding their monetary stimulus, it would affect liquidity flows to emerging markets such as India, thus hurting the domestic currency ""The fact that the Turkish lira has recovered sharply on Tuesday by 5 per cent may ease the pressure on the rupee. In addition, soft CPI number for July will help to ease fears of continued rate hike by the RBI, Deepak Jasani, head (retail research) at HDFC Securities, said However, Salil Datar ­ executive director & CEO, Essel Finance VKC Forex, said: ""Though crude prices have eased, they remain at $72 per barrel levels. So, the typical factors that affect the rupee from an economy point of view have not changed. The lira and the cross-currency impact along with exposure of banks to Turkey is leading to the turmoil... As long as oil continues at current levels, we expect the rupee to trade between 69.50 and 70.25 levels, he said.","The Indian rupee briefly crossed 70 against the US dollar but recovered with RBI intervention and a Turkish lira rebound. Despite gains, the rupee remains Asia's worst-performing currency, depreciating over 9% this year. The current crisis, influenced by factors like oil prices and global liquidity shifts, divides experts' opinions on the rupee's trajectory. While some expect limited impact due to domestic factors like lower inflation and stable FPI flows, others foresee challenges from firm crude prices and global monetary policy changes. The rupee's stability hinges on factors like oil prices and global economic developments.",Business and Finance,2018-08-15 00:00:00
NSA against Varun more political than legal: Omar,"The hate speech of BJP’s Lok Sabha candidate Varun Gandhi did not threaten national security and a law other that the National Security Act could have been invoked to deal with it,says Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah. At the same time,he said he found Varun’s remarks to be “distasteful” and that he was both “disappointed” and “surprised” by them. “It was a hate speech but it didn’t threaten national security. I am sure there are other rules and other laws that could have been used,” he told a TV news channel.“If we weren’t in the middle of an election season which tends to become a silly season,possibly this act (NSA) wouldn’t have been used. I have a feeling that the use of NSA is perhaps more political than actually legally required,” Abdullah said. The National Conference leader said he did not expect such remarks from “somebody with that background,that education,having studied in the United Kingdom,belonging to the family he does”. Abdullah said,”I know his party is supposed to have some influence on him but I didn’t expect the influence to be that strong (given) the kind of words that he did (use)”. He said that what was “shocking” to him is that Varun is a member of the Gandhi family and a person who has seen much more than those belonging to his age group in the country.“One would have expected him to have had a slightly more tolerant outlook to the whole thing haath kaat denge and all that. I found it particularly distasteful,” he said.","Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah stated that the hate speech made by BJP's Lok Sabha candidate Varun Gandhi did not pose a threat to national security, and he believed that other laws could have been invoked to address it, rather than the National Security Act (NSA).

Narela to get cricket stadium,"In a major decision that will give a decisive push to infrastructure development in the Capital and to strengthen New Delhi's claim for hosting the Olympic 2036, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has identified 50 acres of land near the Urban Extension Road-II for development of an international cricket stadium along with a five-star hotel and a world-class medical facility in Narela, north-west Delhi. Currently, Feroz Shah Kotla stadium (now called Arun Jaitley stadium) is the only stadium in Delhi that is used to host international cricket matches. At the meeting with DDA officials, Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena has also directed the authority to further identify land parcels in the vicinity to develop sporting infrastructure related to football, hockey and other Olympic sports, with the view to strengthen Delhi's claims for hosting the Olympics-2036. Raj Niwas official said Lt Governor Saxena has also approved the proposal to float Request for Proposals (RFQ) for the cricket stadium complex at the earliest with the condition for the same to be completed within two years. ""In a departure from the past practice, when DDA would sale land for such projects, it will now be an equity partner in the project on the basis of the cost of land that will be DDA's contribution to the whole enterprise. This, Lieutenant Governor has underlined, would apart from ensuring stake, also ensure recurring income to the DDA,"" official said.

"Delhi CM in judicial custody: 'Arvind Kejriwal’s custodial interrogation may be needed,' says court","NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Saturday sent CM Arvind Kejriwal to judicial custody till July 12 in a corruption case related to the alleged excise policy scam after his three-day CBI custody ended. ""Considering the fact that the conspiracy alleged against the accused involves a large number of persons who were involved in the formulation and implementation of the excise policy and also the persons who acted as facilitators in the use of ill-gotten money, I find that there exist sufficient grounds for remanding the accused to judicial custody,"" said vacation judge Sunena Sharma of the Rouse Avenue courts. She said the probe was still in progress and may require custodial interrogation of the accused to confront him with more material likely to be collected. The court allowed the CM to meet his family and lawyers inside the court. It also allowed him to carry medicines and medical devices required for monitoring and controlling his diabetes. The court passed the order after CBI, represented by special public prosecutor DP Singh, did not seek extension of police custody but requested the court to send the CM to judicial custody for 14 days. CM's Custodial Interrogation May Be Needed, Says Court The court, taking note of the available material, said the investigation had revealed that Vijay Nair, media in-charge of AAP and an accused in the case, was a close associate of the Delhi CM. He was contacting various liquor manufacturers and traders ""for demanding undue gratification"" in order to incorporate provisions favourable to them in the policy, said the court. The name of Kejriwal had surfaced as one of the main conspirators in the criminal conspiracy, the court said. The agency claimed in its application that Kejriwal did not cooperate with the investigation, gave evasive replies and had failed to give a proper and truthful explanation regarding enhancement of the profit margin for wholesalers from 5% to 12% under the policy without any study or justification. CBI told the court that Kejriwal could not explain why during the peak of the second wave of Covid pandemic in 2021, cabinet approval for the revised policy was obtained in a hurried manner and within a day when the accused persons of the South Group were camping in Delhi holding meetings with Nair. He also could not give, CBI claimed, the reasons for Nair holding meetings with various stakeholders in the liquor business in Delhi and of his own meetings with Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, accused Arjun Pandey and accused Mootha Gautham. Reddy is a Telugu Desam Party MP in Lok Sabha and his son, Raghav Magunta Reddy, is an accused-turned-approver in the case. Pandey and Gautham are other accused. The agency expressed apprehension that Kejriwal being the CM may use his influence to tamper with the evidence and may also try to influence potential witnesses who are yet to be examined. Senior advocate Vikram Chaudhri, who was appearing for the Delhi CM, opposed the CBI plea, requesting the court to ask the agency to place on record the entire material, including the case diary and evidence collected during investigation to satisfy the court regarding the need for judicial custody. The counsel urged the court to reject the CBI plea for judicial custody in absence of such material and give a direction for releasing Kejriwal. The investigating officer (IO) has pointed out certain incriminatory material for showing that ill-gotten money was used during the Goa assembly elections for making payments towards air tickets and hotel booking during Kejriwal's visits to Goa from June 2021 to February 2022, the court noted. Further, the court said, the IO has also placed chats of the CM with certain persons involved in the transfer of ill-gotten money to Goa through hawala channels. Since Kejriwal gave evasive replies regarding his connection with the said persons, his further custodial interrogation may be required to ""unearth the larger conspiracy hatched among the accused persons"" in the matter, the court said, noting the contents of the case diary.","Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has been sent to judicial custody until July 12 in connection with the alleged excise policy scam. The court noted the involvement of numerous individuals in the conspiracy and found sufficient grounds for remanding Kejriwal. The CBI did not seek an extension of police custody but requested 14 days of judicial custody, citing ongoing investigations and the need for further interrogation. Kejriwal's potential influence on evidence and witnesses was also a concern. His counsel opposed the plea, asking for evidence to justify the judicial custody, but the court noted incriminating material related to the use of illicit funds in the Goa elections.",Politics,2024-06-30 00:00:00
Why is it harder to find jobs in India's metro cities than in small towns,"The employment gap between India's big cities and small communities is growing, reported the Economic Times (ET). According to staffing companies like Teamlease Services, Xpheno, and Foundit, job creation is still sluggish in the metro areas as companies remain cautious due to macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. In contrast, smaller towns and cities are seeing a thriving demand for manpower as many companies increase their presence to meet rising consumer demand.Data from Teamlease Services shows that in the September quarter, hiring for entry-level white-collar and blue-collar jobs across the manufacturing, banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), telecom, e-commerce increased by 17 per cent Year-on-Year (YoY) in tier-2 and tier-3 towns like Rajpura, Kushaiguda, Hosur, Ludhiana, Jodhpur, Jabalpur, Kalwara, and Zirakpur. This is in contrast to a five per cent decrease in similar jobs in metropolitan cities.Data from Xpheno shows a similar trend- a near twofold jump in entry-level white-collar jobs in small towns in October compared with a year before. The trend is being driven by a number of factors, including the expansion of banks and financial services companies into previously unbanked areas, the rise in e-commerce and retail sales, and the demand for frontline workers in manufacturing sectors like smartphones, electronics, and autos, executives at staffing firms told ET. Kartik Narayan, chief executive of staffing at TeamLease Services, stated that several companies have been looking to expand beyond the metros, which leads to a rise in demand for talent. However, he said that talent is in short supply. ""In BFSI, there is a huge push for personal loan, home loan, credit card sales,"" said Narayan, adding, ""The market is growing for e-commerce and retail companies as well, while phone, electronics, auto and large contract manufacturers need more people to scale up production,"" he was quoted as saying by ET.Co-founder of Xpheno Anil Ethanur agreed, saying, ""Companies in fintech, the non-banking financial institution [NBFC], ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises [MSME], e-commerce, and retail are looking to increase footprint in tier 2 and 3 cities even as hiring in megacities and especially in the technology and startup sectors - the largest employment generators - continue to be muted."" Co-founder of Xpheno Anil Ethanur agreed, saying, ""Companies in fintech, the non-banking financial institution [NBFC], ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises [MSME], e-commerce, and retail are looking to increase their footprint in tier 2 and 3 cities. Although hiring in metro cities and especially in the technology and startup sectors continues to be muted.""","India is witnessing a widening job creation disparity between big cities and smaller towns, per Economic Times (ET). While metro areas exhibit cautious hiring due to macroeconomic uncertainties, tier-2 and tier-3 towns experience a surge in entry-level white-collar and blue-collar jobs across manufacturing, BFSI, telecom, and e-commerce, increasing by 17%. Factors like expanded financial services, e-commerce growth, and demand in manufacturing are driving this trend, with companies pushing into smaller cities. This contrasts with muted hiring in metros, particularly in tech and startups, reflecting a growing demand-supply imbalance.",Business and Finance,2023-11-08 00:00:00

"""Rajan roasts RBI for corporate bank idea""","The headline ""Rajan roasts RBI for corporate bank idea"" - Nov 24, 2020 from The New Indian Express refers to the criticism of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s proposal to allow large non-financial companies to own banks in India by former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan. Rajan argued that allowing large non-financial companies to own banks would lead to increased concentration of ownership in the banking sector and make the sector more vulnerable to shocks. He also argued that it would lead to conflicts of interest, as the non-financial companies would be able to use the banks to finance their own businesses. The RBI's proposal to allow large non-financial companies to own banks is a controversial one. There are both potential benefits and risks associated with the proposal. It is important to carefully consider all of the factors involved before making a decision about whether or not to allow large non-financial companies to own banks.","Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan criticized the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) proposal to allow large non-financial companies to own banks in India.

Chandrayaan-1: The first time India ‘touched’ the Moon,"Chandrayaan-1 carried a module called the Moon Impact Probe, which was dropped to the lunar surface as proof of India’s arrival. Madhavan, what evidence are you going to show before the world that we reached the Moon?” APJ Abdul Kalam asked G Madhavan Nair, the chairman of Isro (2003-2009), prior to the launch of Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. “When we carried out missions to Everest and Antarctica, we placed our flag there. In the case of the Moon mission, we are relying to convince the world with a lot of digital data. Don’t you think we should do something more?” Dr Kalam asked. At the time he raised this question, Dr Kalam was the President of India and the country’s most respected scientific mind. Nair writes in his autobiographical work Rocketing Through the Skies: An Eventful Life at ISRO (2023), that this one simple question modified his entire perspective – giving birth to the concept of the Moon Impact Probe (MIP), carried aboard Chandrayaan-1. As Chandrayaan-3 lands on the Moon today, we recall when India first “planted a flag” on the Moon. India’s first foray to the Moon Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (1924-2018) announced India’s moon mission in his Independence Day speech in 2003. This would be India’s first foray outside Earth’s gravitational pull and the most challenging task undertaken by the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) until then.","Yamunotri Temple is a sacred Hindu shrine nestled in the serene Himalayan mountains of Uttarakhand, India. Dedicated to Goddess Yamuna, the temple holds great religious significance for devotees who believe that a pilgrimage to this sacred site cleanses them of sins and ensures divine blessings. Situated at an elevation of about 3,293 meters (10,804 feet) above sea level, reaching Yamunotri involves a trek through picturesque landscapes and challenging terrains. The temple is surrounded by snow-capped peaks and lush greenery, creating a breathtaking atmosphere for spiritual seekers. The main deity, Goddess Yamuna, is worshipped in the form of a black marble idol adorned with flowers and garments. The temple's hot water spring, called Surya Kund, is an integral part of the pilgrimage, as devotees cook rice and potatoes in the naturally heated water to offer as Prasad (sacred food). Yamunotri Temple is not just a religious site; it is also a cultural and natural treasure.

"Both State, Central Govts are anti-farmer'","Hundreds of farmers under the banner of the Akhila Bharat Krushak Sangathan Samannwaya Samiti and the All India Kishan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), Odisha chapter, took to the streets here on Monday raising various issues concerning farmers’ community in the State and the country. Farmers from various districts across the State staged a ‘Krushak Adhikar Chetabani Samavesh’ holding banners and shouting slogans against Government’s apathy towards the community. A team of representatives from the neighbouring State of West Bengal and the Sarba Bharatiya Kishan Sangharsh Jatha (Jatra) also joined the stir. Environmentalist and farmer leader Prafulla Samantray joined the protest and termed both the State Government and the Centre as anti-farmer. He alleged that the State Government is yet to give bonus to the farmers and urged the Centre to increase the paddy MSP to Rs 2,930 per quintal. Similarly, the Centre hiked the paddy MSP by a mere Rs 80 when the Prime Minister had earlier promised to double the price. Besides, no steps have been taken to waive farm loans, he added. Jai Kisan Andolan founder Yogendra Yadav said if Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik is not able to solve the problems of farmers at least he should accept the farmer’s suicide in the State. Till date the country had a number of Prime Ministers but none of them is anti-farmer like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he added. Members of the various national organisatons alleged that farmers are not the getting remunerative prices of their produces. They mentioned that due to the burden of agricultural loan, as many as 36,000 farmers have committed suicide during the three-year tenure of the Modi Government. They said many companies have looted about Rs 21,500 crore as premium from the State and Central Governments under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. They said that the country’s 121 crore people are dependent upon the farmers, but the farmers are most neglected. They demanded that the State and Central Government free farmers from the dept trap, to provide profitable MSP for all agricultural produces as per the Swaminathan Commission recommendation, provide land to landless, concede forest rights to the tribals and forest dwellers and provide Rs 5,000 monthly pension to all farmers. AIKSCC convenor VM Singh, All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah, Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, Madhya Pradesh president Dr Sunilam, Odisha Krushak Sabha’s (OKS) Suresh Panigrahi, All India Kishan Mahasabha’s (AIKM) Ashok Pradhan, All India Kishan Majdoor Sabha’s (AIKMS) Bhalachandra Sarangi and others spoke on the anti-farmer policies of the State and Central Governments.","Farmers from various districts in Odisha, organized by Akhila Bharat Krushak Sangathan Samannwaya Samiti and All India Kishan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), protested against the government's neglect of farmers' issues.

Not received any Sebi request for further audit in whistleblower case: Infosys,"Infosys on Friday said it has not received any request from Sebi for conducting further investigation in the whistleblower case where top executives were accused of rigging the company's balance sheet.

Sustainable workplaces | Encouraging green HR practices,"Very recently Mahindra&Mahindra got caught on the wrong foot. A picture of M&M’s Board meeting was shared on Twitter, where a user pointed out use of disposable plastic bottles in the Board meeting of the company. This promptly led Mr. Mahindra to take ownership and banish plastic bottles from meetings and replace them with environment friendly alternatives. This simple narrative points out how the organisers of the meeting had not thought about the environmental implications of their actions (using plastic bottles in the meeting), when the company is actively promoting environment and sustainability, and this may be true for employees across organisations as well, who are neither aware nor committed to the environmental cause. Hence, employee involvement becomes important for organisations on its sustainability journey. Smart organisations know how to ensure core values of their organisation. This can happen either by persuading their employees or by giving them a clear message. Organisations that have made greening a priority for themselves expect environment-centric behaviour from their people and this has resulted in judicious utilisation of resources. In addition, consistent assessment of environmental impact while taking business decisions, recycling and repurposing of resources and adoption of sustainable forms of different resources are some other important parameters. About sustainability and sustainable workplace Sustainability, greening the corporation, environment management are gradually becoming a part of the corporate vocabulary. The way the natural resources are extracted and consumed from earth, it is going to be very difficult to replenish them timely. It is often discussed in various forums that for generating the resources we spend in one year; earth takes around 1.5 years for the re-generation. Hence, it can be assumed that there will a requirement of the capacity of almost two Earths by 2030 to keep pace with the present natural resource consumption, and the requirement will be of three planets by 2050. Experts have always warned people about the impacts of climate change, global warming and the recent onset of a pandemic (Covid-19) can completely rewire people’s brains. All these environmental changes will have far reaching impact on humanity and life force on the planet. They would be designed in such a way that they work on People-Planet-Profit (PPP) methodologies, thereby providing benefits to all the stakeholders. The architecture, building, resources employed would all be designed to function on the principles that promote sustainability. The current requirement is towards developing long-term, meaningful relationships, and self-discipline for attaining effective results. Thus, the design of the workplace is such that supports the basic and core idea in a more accommodating and comprehensive manner. When employees find the conviction among their leaders, they tend to behave in the manner that supports green and sustainable way of working in an interrelated and interlinked way. A Green workplace is an eco-friendly and focused organisation and leans towards the adoption of business practices that are justifiable in nature, energy efficient, and well suited to the complex as well as the ever-changing world of business. It advocates the model based on 3Rs — reduce, reuse, recycle. It is not only green building and green infrastructure, rather it has a much broader scope. It encompasses green competencies, green attitude, and green behaviour, which is combined synergistically to help the organisation become green or sustainable. Values are the essential characteristic that both employees and organisations uphold and operate at multiple levels (societal, organisational and personal), thus playing a fundamental role in shaping the organisation’s culture with regard to a shift towards greater sustainability. Recent changes post COVID-19 in HR domain A lot of changes were witnessed post pandemic in the very year of 2020. Globally, work from office (if not completely zero) definitely went on the downward slide. At the same time, thanks to availability of internet and online working option availability, work was not completely shut. Although, work from office was very less, we could experiment with new working models in most of the industries and companies of all sizes. Though we were not meeting face-to-face, we were still connected. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of technology and digital way of working tremendously. Now, with the vaccine discussions, new experiments are being made. These include mixing remote and office work with safety protocols, remote management, making tough decisions like giving furlough to some workers and growing the roles of others, engagement, learning, monitoring and evaluating so that the business of the organisation can happen as usual. Global industry analyst Josh aptly mentioned at Perspectives 2020, “For us in HR, it is really time to be the heroic leaders of the response.” Thus, the HR is experimenting and finding opportunity the year of the pandemic and following year with huge expectations and the big acceleration of the transformation HR. The enmeshment of all aspects has caused a sea change in how people are working at home, trying to strike a balance among all the domains. The clear segregation between home and work has today blurred, integration, of an ‘enforced’ kind is in place which is different from the voluntary work from home which companies used to give. Thus, in this process of transformation and management of unprecedented situation, HR is gaining smoothly greater importance. Work from home and sustainable aspects Although, work from home (WFH) was always advocated by HR fraternity (as it gives the opportunity for work life integration), the actual decision to allow the employees to work from home was a difficult one. The principal risk to firms when allowing employees to work from home is a potential inability to monitor those employees to the same degree as would be possible if he or she worked in a traditional office setting. During Covid-19, the situations are different. Everyone is worried about health and wellbeing related aspects. Supply chains are disrupted. Daily and essential works are taking more time as no support is available at home. More than that, all the family members are available all the time at the same place with kids not going outside is an extra burden of managing and engaging them with lots of patience. Along with that the individual difference of managing stress and uncertainties also play an important role when we talk about working effectively in this uncertain times. Working from home or working at home during the Covid-19 pandemic has given rise to realities which are reframing the very fabric of our social, occupational, and emotional lives. Not surprisingly, the nature of WFH has changed in recent years. The cost to employees of corresponding with employers and co-workers quickly and effectively from a distance has fallen dramatically. In addition, the positive aspect can be seen that resource utilisation has gone down dramatically. Due to WFH and less commute required, there seem chances that less people need to travel daily to attend their office. The proposed hybrid model, where WFH and online learning will be a part, lesser vehicles will be needed on the road. That will definitely impact positively in terms of less polluted air and sound. Due to digital way of working, prevalence of electronic mail, video conferencing software, and mobile communication through ubiquitous cellular communications networks, the usage of electricity, paper will go down. Leaders’ role in encouraging sustainability in organisations The role of leadership is pivotal when it comes to encouraging sustainability in organisations. CEOs across companies and nationalities are understanding the importance of committing to sustainability and have placed sustainability on top of their agenda. The seriousness of climate threat and the growing awareness around environmental issues is making organisations commit to reducing their contribution to pollution and depletion of natural resources. Indian organisations have become a part of the Carbon Disclosure Project thereby committing to reduce emission of carbon but recent reports show that CDP has pulled up 20 Indian organisations for their weak sustainability disclosures. A recent CDP India Annual Report also discloses that Indian companies are not much concerned about deforestation and do not make a realistic assessment of the impact of their business on deforestation. This indicates the lack of seriousness to take environmental impact of business into consideration. This is where the role of leadership becomes highly significant. Integrating sustainability and environmental issues into the strategy of business can only be accomplished at the highest level of the organisation. We need the business leaders to step up and work towards becoming more sustainable. There are examples of leaders who have taken sustainability to be the most important driver of their business. Yvon Chouinard of Patagonia is a shining example of sustainable leadership. He not only made sustainability a part of his business but also worked with his vendors to make their businesses sustainable. His contribution to the environment extended to producing documentaries meant to sensitise people on environmental issues. Late Y.C. Deveshwar, former Chairman of ITC Ltd. in an interview had stated that sustainability was a key to gain competitive advantage. The current CEO and MD of ITC, Sanjiv Puri has committed to stretch goals to improve its sustainability performance by 2030 by replacing 50% of the company’s energy consumption with renewable sources. These examples demonstrate the leader’s vision and commitment to sustainability are imperative to promote sustainability in organisations. The leader’s beliefs about environmental conservation and a vision centered around sustainability can motivate employees to take up the environmental cause. The leader can become a catalyst in enhancing awareness on sustainability by making it a part of the corporate vocabulary and integrating sustainability as a value in the organisation’s culture.","Mahindra & Mahindra faced backlash for using plastic bottles during a Board meeting, prompting Mr. Mahindra to ban them in favor of eco-friendly alternatives. This incident underscores the need for employee engagement in sustainability efforts. As companies prioritize environmental practices, leadership plays a critical role in fostering a culture of sustainability. The pandemic accelerated remote work, reducing resource consumption and pollution. Leaders like Yvon Chouinard of Patagonia exemplify how commitment to sustainability can drive organizational change. To promote sustainability effectively, leaders must inspire employees to integrate environmental responsibility into the corporate culture.",Business and Finance,2021-02-21 00:00:00
Guru Nanak ideology represents enduring values: Rahul in Punjab,"[Nation](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation) Guru Nanak ideology represents enduring values: Rahul in Punjab CHANDIGARH: Senior Congress leader, Rahul Gandhi on Thursday alleged that the BJP intends to dismantle and discard the Constitution. Addressing farmers at Khatkar Kalan in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district on the final day of campaigning before Phase 7 of the Lok Sabha elections on June 1, Gandhi described the 2024 Lok Sabha election as a clash of ideologies. Gandhi asserted that the Constitution, representing Guru Nanak’s ideology in modern India, embodies enduring values. He criticised the RSS and BJP for their attempts to amend Constitution. Gandhi stated, “We will waive farm loans and provide a legal guarantee for minimum support prices. For the first time in independent India, we see an assault on the Constitution. Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, and BJP leaders have explicitly stated their intention to discard the Constitution drafted by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.” Clutching a copy of the Constitution, Rahul emphasised its significance beyond being a mere document, asserting that it embodies the wisdom of Guru Nanak. “When the BJP and RSS assail it, they assail the nation’s history and soul. Safeguarding Ambedkar’s Constitution is paramount in this election,” he declared, displaying the document to the audience. Present at the event was Congress party’s Anandpur Sahib candidate, Vijay Inder Singla, who expressed his delight at visiting the birthplace of the legendary martyr Bhagat Singh. Beyond a document Clutching a copy of the Constitution, Rahul Gandhi emphasised significance of it beyond being a mere document, asserting that it embodies the wisdom of Guru Nanak and other revered figures.","Senior Congress leader, Rahul Gandhi on Thursday alleged that the BJP intends to dismantle and discard the Constitution.

Entrepreneurship in mushroom production,"The oyster mushroom is one of the most suitable fungal organism for producing protein rich food from various agro wastes without composting. The mushroom is cultivated in about 25 countries of Far- East Asia, Europe and America. It is the third largest cultivated mushroom in the world. China alone contributed 88 per cent of the total world production. The other major oyster producing countries are Japan, Italy, Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea and Philippines. In India, it is popularly grown in the states of Orissa, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and the North- Eastern states. Nutritional and medicinal value of oyster mushroom: This mushroom is 100 per centvegetarian and the nutritive value of oyster mushroom is a good as other edible mushrooms, like white button mushroom, shitake or paddy straw mushroom. They are rich in vitamin C and B complex. Protein content varies between 1.6 to 2.5 on fresh weight basis. It has most of the mineral salts required by the human body, such as potassium, sodium, phosphorus, iron and calcium. The niacin content is about ten times higher than any other vegetables. A polycyclic aromatic compound pleurotin has been isolated from P.griseus, which possess antibiotic properties. Varieties: All the varieties of oyster are dibble expect P.nidiformis and P.olearius, which are reported to be poisonous. In recent years, 25 species are commercially cultivated in different parts of the world, which are: P. florida, P. flabellatus, P.ostreatus, P. sajor-caju, P. sapidusetc. Cultivation: The procedure for oyster mushroom of spawn. Cultivation can be divided into following four steps. Preparation or procurement: Substrate preparation; spawning: Crop management; preparation or procurement: The spawn preparation technique for oyster mushroom is a similar to white button mushroom. One should have a pure culture of pleurotusspp for inoculation on sterilized wheat grains. It takes 10 to 15 days for mycelia growth on grains. It has been reported that jowar and bajragrains are superior over wheat grains. The mycelium of oyster mushroom grows very fast on wheat grains and 25 to 30 days old spawn starts forming fruit bodies in the bottle itself. Substrate preparation: Different type of agricultural, forest and agro-industrial by- products, are useful for growing oyster mushroom. These by products or wastes are rich in cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose. However, yield of oyster mushroom largely depends upon the nutrition and nature of the substrate. Method of the substrate preparation: The mycelium of pleurotus is saprophytic in nature and it does not require selective substrate for its growth. The popular methods of substrate preparation are as follows: Steam pasteurization: In this method prewetted straw is packed in wooden trays or boxes and then kept in a pasteurization room at 58-62 0C for four hours. Temperature of the pasteurization room is manipulated with the help of steam through a boiler. Substrate after cooling at a room temperature is seeded with spawn. The entire process takes around 3-5 days. This method is adopted on a commercial scale. Hot Water treatment: The substrate (wheat straw) after chopping around 5-10 cm is soaked in hot water (65-700C) for one to two hour or in case of paddy straw at 85 0C for 45-55 minutes. After draining excess water and cooling, spawn is added. Hot water treatment makes the hard substrate like maize cobs, stems, etc soft so that the growth of mycelial takes place easily. This method is not suitable for commercial cultivation. Chemical Treatment: Different species of trichoderma, Penicillium, Aspergillus and Gliocladium are the common competitor fungi on the straw during oyster mushroom cultivation. Ninety litres of waters is taken in a rust proof drum or G.I. tub of 200 litre capacity. Ten to twelve Kg of wheat straw is slowly steeped in water. In other plastic bucket, Bavistin 7.5 g and 125 ml formaldehyde is dissolved and slowly poured on the already soaked straw. Straw is pressed and covered with a polythene sheet. After 15-18 hour the straw taken out and excess water drained. Spawning: The spawning should be done in a pre-fumigated room with 2% formaldehyde for 48 hour. 20 30 days old spawn is best for spawning. The spawn should be mixed @ 2 to 3 % of the wet weight of the substrate. 10 to 12 kg of wet substrate or 2.7 to 3 kg of dry substrate is sufficient for 300 g spawn. Spawn can be mixed thoroughly or mixed in layers. Spawn substrate is filled in polythene bags (60×45 cm) of 125 to 150 gauze thickness. 10 to 14 small holes (0.5-1.0 cm diameter) should be made on all sides especially in the bottom for leaching of excess water. Perforated bags higher and early crop (5-6 days) than non-perforated bags because of accumulation of high CO2, which inhibits fruiting. One can also use empty fruit packing cartoon or wooden boxes for filling substrate. The polythene sheet is folded from all the four sides to make a compact rectangular box. It is tightly pressed and tied with a nylon rope. The block is incubated as such and after mycelial growth polythene sheet is removed. Crop Management: The spawn bags or blocks are kept in incubation room for mycelialgrowth. Spawned bags can be kept on a raised platform or can be hanged in cropping room for mycelial colonization of the substrate. Mycelium can grow between 10-30 0C but optimum temperature lies between 22 to 26°C. The temperature more than 30° C in the cropping room will inhibit the growth and kill the mycelium. During mycelia growth the bag are not to be opened and no vitalization is needed. Moreover, there is no needed for any high relative humidity, so no water should be spread. All the plutorius species require high relative humidity (75-85%) during fruiting. To maintain relative humidity, water spraying is to be done in cropping rooms. During hot and dry weather conditions daily 2-3 spray are recommended while in hot and humid conditions one light spray will be sufficient. Post-Harvest Management: Mushroom should always be harvested before water spray. The right stage of picking can be identified by the shape and size of fruit body. In, young mushrooms, the edge of the cap is thick and cap margin is enrolled while the cap of mature mushroom is flat and inward curling starts. It is advisable to harvest all the mushrooms at one time from a bag so that a next crop of mushroom starts early. After harvesting lower portion of the stalk, adhering debris should be cut with a knife. Fresh mushrooms should be packed in perforated polythene bags for marketing. The can also be sun dried by spreading on a cotton cloth in bright sun light or diffused light. The dried produced with 2-4% moisture can be stored for 3 to 4 months after proper sealing.(The writer is Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Tawang, SMS Agri Extension)","The oyster mushroom, favored for its ability to utilize agricultural waste, is widely cultivated globally, particularly in Asia, Europe, and America. Notably, China dominates production, contributing 88% of the global yield, with other major producers including Japan, Italy, and Thailand. In India, it thrives in states like Orissa, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. Rich in nutrients and medicinal value, the mushroom boasts high protein content, essential minerals, and vitamins. Cultivation involves spawn preparation, substrate treatment, and cropping management. Various methods like steam pasteurization and hot water treatment facilitate growth.

"LS election: Overseas voter turnout drops to 2.5% from 25.6% in 2019; nil in TN, Karnataka","Compared to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, overseas voters turnout in the 2024 general elections plunged to 2.47 per cent from 25.64 per cent, showed an analysis of a recent statistical report shared by the Election Commission. The elections saw the BJP-led NDA government returning to power and the INDIA bloc gaining numerical strength in the Lok Sabha. There were 1,19,374 registered overseas electors in 2024, however, only 2,958 of them exercised their franchise at the respective polling booths in India, the report’s analysis showed. In 2019, there were a total of 99,844 overseas voters and of them, 25,606 cast their votes. Of the 17 states and UTs where overseas electors are registered, those in seven states and two UTs exercised their franchise. Five states — Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka — comprise 90 per cent of the country’s total overseas electors. Of them, turnout was nil in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Highest enrolment of overseas electors in 2024 was recorded in five southern states – Kerala (89,839), Andhra Pradesh (7,927), Telangana (3,470), Tamil Nadu (3,432) and Karnataka (3,148). Kerala’s turnout dropped from 29.13 per cent in 2019 to 2.97 per cent in 2024, diminishing the overall turnout of overseas voters this year. Andhra Pradesh’s turnout, on the other hand, improved from five of 5,090 registered voters casting their votes to 195 of 7,927 voting this time. Telangana’s turnout also rose marginally from nil in 2019 to three out of 3,470 electors casting their votes. In seven states — Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, J&K — no new overseas voter registered for the 2024 polls. Same was the case for three UTs — Andaman and Nicobar, Lakshadweep, and Ladakh. In the northeast, Meghalaya was an exception with five registered voters, but no one turned up on the day of voting. In Maharashtra, which has the third-largest number of overseas electors of 5,097, only 17 of them cast their votes. In Uttar Pradesh, where INDIA bloc secured more seats than NDA, none of 859 overseas electors turned up to vote, while six of 244 registered electors voted in 2019. In Punjab, 13 out of 1,613 registered voters cast their votes, while 33 of 1,523 overseas electors voted in 2019. Haryana’s turnout went up from nil in 2019 to 37 voters casting their votes. Though the number of registered voters went up in Rajasthan from 194 in 2019 to 289 this year, turnout was nil. As per the Election Commission, an overseas voter must be a citizen of India and has not acquired citizenship of any other country and is otherwise eligible to be registered as a voter, who is absenting from his place of ordinary residence in India owing to his employment","Overseas voter turnout in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections dropped drastically to 2.47%, compared to 25.64% in 2019, as per Election Commission data.

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds review: Go for it if you are into multiplayer games,"The launch version of PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds gives multi-player gaming a fresh lease of life January 15, 2018 06:21 pm | Updated January 16, 2018 12:52 pm IST In March 2017, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds was unleashed on the world on Steam, the popular game distribution system, in Early Access beta. Despite the numerous bugs, the game spread like wildfire, becoming a worldwide phenomenon. Now, finally, the game has officially been launched with a 1.0 on PC, as well as a presence on Xbox One. What’s it about? PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds was the brainchild of Brendan Greene, who goes by the handle PlayerUnknown. Inspired by the gory film Battle Royale , he created a mod for ARMA 2 called DayZ: Battle Royale, based on DayZ, which became quite popular. It was only after Battlegrounds was launched, that the battle royale game mode started gaining immense popularity, spawning off Epic Games’ Fortnite, which also has a battle royale mode, in a more Overwatch-like setting. Think of Battlegrounds as a cross between Battle Royale , The Hunger Games and a tactical military shooter, all rolled up in one. How does it play? The premise of the game is simple. Each match has you and 99 other players jump off a plane, onto a map, armed with nothing. Everything on this map is randomised, and you can choose where to parachute down to. Once you touch down, then starts a mad scramble for weapons and vehicles. Players have to survive the initial onslaught, scavenging and staying alive until everyone on the map has been wiped out; you win if you’re the last man standing. If you parachuted out as a team, then it’s down to the last team standing, with the words ‘Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner’ to celebrate your victory. The fun doesn’t end there. As the game progresses and the herd is thinned, the map keeps shrinking in. It forces players to converge down to the inevitable showdown at the centre, or die slowly as the map’s incandescent moving walls kill you. As a multi-player game, the battle royale concept is fantastic, now even more so, as Battlegrounds is at the zenith of its lifecycle. Matches are available easily, and in no time you’ll be parachuting down towards your inevitable death, or that fabled ‘Chicken Dinner’ we spoke about. The downside of the battle royale is that if you’re one of those unlucky folks, like this reviewer, who dies within five minutes of touching down, then you’re in for a long wait, either until the whole match gets over, watching as a ghostly spectator, or until you quit and wait for another game. Though spectating is a lot of fun too, and you will get to learn from others’ tactics, PUBG is a testament to how deep you need to dive into the game, from forming strategies to learning how to make the best of every situation. All these are key to winning, and they’re part of the whole Battlegrounds experience, which most games, even the Battlegrounds’ rip-offs, don’t have. Being an indie game, when it launched in Early Access, there were a lot of graphical and gameplay glitches. Now, Battlegrounds is a polished gem, with a beautiful new desert map. Should you get it? If you love multiplayer games and are bored of the usual static battlefields and tired game modes, then PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is perfect for you.","The article discusses the official launch of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) with version 1.0 on PC and Xbox One. PUBG, created by Brendan Greene, gained worldwide popularity after its initial release on Steam Early Access beta in March 2017. The game follows a battle royale format where 100 players parachute onto a map, scavenge for weapons, and fight to be the last person or team standing. The article highlights the game's simple yet engaging premise, the excitement of surviving until the end, and the strategic elements involved in playing. Despite initial bugs during the Early Access phase, PUBG has become a global phenomenon and has contributed to the popularity of the battle royale game mode.

Justice Gavai will uphold SC values: CJI Khanna,"Overwhelmed by the rich accolades on his last day at the Supreme Court (SC), the Chief Justice of India (CJI), Sanjiv Khanna on Tuesday said he was certain his successor CJI-designate Justice BR Gavai would uphold values of the SC, fundamental rights and the basic constitutional doctrines. The ceremonial bench comprised the outgoing CJI, Justice Gavai, and Justice Sanjay Kumar, showcasing a rare moment of reflection, celebration, and reverence, not just for Justice Khanna’s contributions, but the legacy of his uncle, former SC judge Justice HR Khanna, he took forward. The CJI called Justice Gavai his “biggest support” while expressing confidence in the latter’s leadership and commitment to constitutional values. “What to say about justice and CJI designate BR Gavai, we got elevated the same year. Here we are in the collegium, and thereafter, we have interacted on several occasions. And I must say, he has been my biggest support. And I am sure that you have in Justice Gavai an excellent chief justice who’s going to uphold the institution and who’s going to uphold the fundamental rights who’s going to uphold our basic doctrines which we have adopted and applied,” he said. In his parting remarks, Justice Khanna expressed gratitude, reflecting on the memories he carries from his years in the judiciary and said, “I am overwhelmed. I carry with me a lot of memories. Memories that are very nice and will remain with me throughout my life,” he said. Emphasising the role of the bar and the bench in earning public trust, he shared, “The judiciary is not just judges; it includes the bar. You are the conscious keepers of the system.” Later interacting with journalists, CJI Khanna said though he was not going to accept any post-retirement official assignments, he would continue his innings in law. “I will not accept any post-retirement post... .Perhaps will do something with law,” he said. Many former SC judges begin their innings in arbitration post judgeship. “I will have a third innings and will do something related to law,” the CJI said. Justice Khanna, who was elevated to the top court in January 18, 2019, was appointed as the CJI on November 11, 2024. Justice Gavai, who would assume the CJI office on May 14, said Justice Khanna “embraced his legacy” and built his own. He called it not a farewell but a transition and said, “What ends today is not a career, but the beginning of another.” Justice Gavai acknowledged the weight of legacy Justice Khanna bore as the nephew of Justice H R Khanna, the lone dissenter in the 1976 ADM Jabalpur case who stood for constitutional rights during the emergency. “To walk in the shadow of such a name is no small task,” he said, “but Justice Sanjiv Khanna did more than uphold that legacy he made it his own.” Justice Gavai praised his predecessor for his clarity, moral conviction, and commitment to fundamental rights, describing his judgments as “simple, elegant, and imbued with constitutional values”. Justice Sanjay Kumar, who sat alongside the CJI for over 10 months, reflected candid and heartfelt insights into Justice Khanna’s working style. “He doesn’t make notes. Everything: page numbers, paragraph numbers, contents come from memory,” he said. “Even when advocates came unprepared, he never lost his temper. Instead, he gently urged them to come prepared next time,” said Justice Kumar. When it came to the bar, Attorney General R Venkataramani said CJI Khanna added “immense value” to the court. “Your lordship leaves a void not easily filled. Like a river flowing quietly, you accomplished much with grace,” he said. The judgments, the CJI penned, were stated to carry “impeccable logic, simplicity, and elegance”. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta commended the CJI’s legal acumen and clarity in judgment. “Even if litigants lost, we lawyers felt enriched. We always left with a new insight,” he said, “as your verdicts were crisp, clear, and always enlightening.” The Supreme Court Bar Association president and senior lawyer Kapil Sibal apart from other bar members and lawyers showered praises on the outgoing CJI. Sibal called Justice Khanna “a beacon of light” who elevated the stature of the court. Saying he symbolised the best in a judge, Sibal went on, “Your intuitive sense of justice, your transparency, and your encouragement to young lawyers will not be forgotten. You’ve set a standard for generations to come.” Reflecting on Justice H R Khanna’s historic dissent in the ADM Jabalpur case, Sibal drew a parallel and said, “Today, that dissent echoes louder than the forgotten majority. And you, Justice Khanna, have carried that flame forward.” “You may be retiring from the bench,” said another senior lawyer, “but your service to the Constitution is far from over.” Justice Khanna was elevated as the 51st Chief Justice of India on November 11, 2024, and demitted office on May 13, 2025. His tenure, though brief, was marked by landmark decisions, transparency initiatives, and a steadfast commitment to judicial accountability and constitutional morality.","Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna expressed gratitude and reflected on his memories as he retired from the Supreme Court. He praised his successor, CJI-designate Justice BR Gavai, saying he would uphold the institution's values and fundamental rights.

ISRO to launch record 103 satellites in single flight in Feb,"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is all set to launch a record 103 satellites in one go using its workhorse PSLV-C37 in the first week of February.As many as 100 of the satellites set for launch in February belong to foreign nations, including the United States and Germany. ""We are making a century by launching over 100 satellites at one go,"" said S Somnath, Director of the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre of the ISRO.That ambitious figure is an improvement on the space agency's statement last week that said it will launch 83 satellites in one go. With the addition of 20 more foreign satellites, the launch was delayed by a week and will now take place in first week of February, Somnath said.Of the 83 satellites planned earlier, 80 belonged to Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland and the US.

"loP demands CM's resignation, Vigilance DG's suspension","leader of Opposition (loP) and veteran Congress leader Narasingha Mishra on Saturday strongly denounced the State Government’s act of implicating former DGP Prakash Mishra in a false case to block his way to become CBI Director last year.He demanded resignation of the Chief Minister and suspension of the Vigilance Director for hatching a “well-planned conspiracy” against the former DGP.Mishra quoting Prakash Mishra’s petition said the Government became furious after the ex-DGP refused to bow down to political pressure while discharging his responsibilities during investigation of the chit fund and mining scams and seizure of huge amounts of money during the last year’s general elections. The loP demanded an impartial probe into the alleged cash distribution by the ruling BJD during the polls. He said the Congress would move the Election Commission of India (ECI) to look into the matter seriously.After reading the FIR against Prakash Mishra, the loP said it was found that the allegation against him was false and baseless. The HC judgment in favour of Mishra, now CRPF DG, proves that the Home Department (which is in the hand of the Chief Minister) and its Vigilance Directorate had lodged the FIR with mala-fide intention to lower Mishra’s public image. “I have never seen such an ‘interesting’ case in my 50 years of law practice where the investigating agency neither recorded statement of witness nor submitted documentary evidence before filing its final report,” said the loP, adding, “Interestingly, the Vigilance Directorate on September 11 last year had served notices to raw material supply companies regarding the case and submitted its final report on the same day.”Notably, the Vigilance FIR had alleged that Mishra during his tenure as the CMD of the State Police Housing and Welfare Corporation had favoured raw material suppliers.","The leader of Opposition (loP) and Congress leader Narasingha Mishra has criticized the State Government for implicating former DGP Prakash Mishra in a false case to hinder his appointment as CBI Director.

"Microsoft outage leaves China largely unaffected despite causing global disruptions, here's why","A global tech outage that appeared to be related to issues at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and Microsoft, affected operations at airports, airlines, banks, and media outlets on Friday. CrowdStrike is not a household name but it is an $83 billion company with more than 20,000 subscribers around the world including Amazon.com, and Microsoft. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said on social media platform X that a defect was found ""in a single content update for Windows hosts"" that affected Microsoft customers. However, according to a report in the South China Morning Post, amid the global outage, China remained predominantly unaffected, according to industry sources and social media posts. There were no reports of China facing any major infrastructure breakdowns. The international airports in Beijing and Shanghai, as per their website, were operating normally. On Weibo, Chinese netizens jokingly said that Microsoft ""has given them a half-day off"". One said that ""Our company just switched to new computers with the HarmonyOS system, so we can't join in your celebration"". Microsoft's China website and social media channels avoided issuing any emergency notices as China's public services remained mostly unaffected due to the outage. Why did the Microsoft outage not affect China? The main reason why the Microsoft outage did not affect China is because Microsoft's cloud services in the country are mostly operated by local partner 21Vianet. Due to China's regulatory provision that makes it compulsory for foreign cloud services to be run by domestic companies, their set-up is largely separate from Microsoft's global infrastructure. This makes the configurations and functions of Microsoft's services in China distinguishable and protected from issues affecting other parts of the world. This separation is one of the main reasons why Microsoft's services remained largely unaffected in China despite causing major disorders in other parts of the world.","A global tech outage affected operations at airports, airlines, banks, and media outlets on Friday, reportedly related to issues at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and Microsoft.

"Pune Porsche car crash: 90-day process to determine whether teen should be tried as adult, says lawyer","A Juvenile Justice Board will decide whether or not the teenager involved in mowing down two people with his luxury race car earlier this week, should be tried as an adult, the lawyer representing the accused said. Addressing media persons in Pune on May 22, Prashant Patil, lawyer of the accused said, “The Juvenile Justice Act has procedures to determine whether the accused Child in Conflict with Law (CCL) be considered a minor or an adult. It takes almost 90 days to conduct this procedure.” Pune Porsche car accident: Juvenile's father, two pub employees sent to police custody “If a juvenile or CCL is arrested, investigative agencies must file a charge sheet within 30 days of the arrest to consider them as an adult. After the charge sheet is filed, a two-month procedure follows, which includes psychological and social assessments along with a de-addiction test,” he added. According to the lawyer, the individual doesn’t need to remain in rehabilitation for these procedures, as the investigation is carried out further. Mr. Patil said that the Juvenile Justice Board monitors the assessments through regular reports and complaints reports and decides after nearly 90 days whether to treat the minor or CCL as an adult. He further said, “In response to the applications from investigation agencies to modify the bail issued, the honourable Juvenile Justice Board on the operative orders, has directed to keep the Child in Conflict with Law (CCL) to keep in a rehabilitation home for 14 days, until June 5. We have opposed the application based on academic considerations and legal points. There were debates and arguments in court from both sides, with both parties citing quotes from the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court,” he said. Mr. Patil further explained that the Juvenile Justice Board has set parameters regarding rehabilitating CCL within the 15-day remand period. These details will be fully outlined upon receipt of the written order. The Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) on May 22 evening cancelled the bail of the 17-year-old accused of mowing down a biker and a pillion rider in his Porsche in the early hours of May 19. The accused was sent to a remand home for 14 days, until June 5. Pune Commissioner of Police, Amitesh Kumar said that they had filed in a review application before the Juvenile Justice Board to allow the juvenile to be treated as an adult in the case and also to send him in the remand home. Two IT professionals, identified as Ashwini Koshta and Aneesh Awadhia, both from Madhya Pradesh, were killed in the accident. According to officials, the accused’s father had not cooperated in the investigation, prompting Pune police to seek him for further questioning in the case. When the police gave him notice to join the investigation before his arrest, he misled them by stating that he was in Shirdi. He was, however, found to be in Aurangabad. Police also sought the custody of the staff of the bar where the accused teenager and his friend were served liquor. Allegedly, the 17-year-old later crashed luxury car he was driving into a motorcycle resulting in the deaths of two people. Police said there was no board on the premises of the bar that said alcohol couldn’t be served to minors.

BS Yeddyurappa gives BJP sleepless nights,"BANGALORE: Out on bail, former Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa poses fresh challenges for BJP's central leadership. The party will need to confront the clout of its tallest Karnataka leader but weakest link in its campaign against the Congress-led central government on corruption in high places. Yeddyurappa is unhappy with the party's central leadership for having asked him to quit after the Lokayukta report in July indicted him in the illegal mining scam in the state. That Yeddyurappa, credited for the formation of the BJP's first government in Karnataka, in 2008, remained powerful even after his position became untenable as chief minister was evident when he was allowed to choose his successor. But this was reaffirmed tellingly when his supporters, including a dozen ministers in his hand-picked chief minister DV Sadananda Gowda's Cabinet, boycotted the party's senior-most leader LK Advani's Jan Chetna rally in Bangalore recently. And now, he has walked out of jail and is back into the fold of his supporters. Despite being an accused in multi-crore land scam cases, Yeddyurappa seemingly retains his formidable Lingayat base, which propelled him to power and remains his bargaining chip for a possible repositioning within the party. While in power, Yeddyurappa doled out several sops to cultivate his support base, which constitutes around 15% of the population and is capable of swinging the electoral fortunes. He also eroded the appeal of his competitors within the party and managed to build a loyal group of supporters by offering them ministries or positions on boards and corporations. Yeddyurappa also managed to cultivate the pontiffs of the Lingayat community's various mutts that wield considerable influence. Even as Advani has spoken out against Yeddyurappa, the state unit of the party is bound to be wary of taking on the former chief minister as it has the potential of rubbing its most-important votebank the wrong way. Now that he has emerged from custody after 24 days, the ball is firmly in the court of the man who seems to have become bigger than his party in the state.""","Former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa, out on bail, poses challenges for the BJP's central leadership. Despite facing accusations in a land scam, Yeddyurappa retains support, especially among the Lingayat community.

He de­mands the government ste­p in, suggesting biometric tracking and new rule­s to tackle the situation. Mee­tei is concerned, he­'s noticed that his constituency is a melting pot of various communitie­s, some of whom are immigrants. In his belie­f, they manage to gain voter status through marriage­s. He encourages all MLAs and locals to he­lp out in stopping illegal immigration and land snatching. Meete­i is worried about how many illegal immigrants are­ coming into the valley. He accuse­s them of building bunkers in outskirts areas whe­n the operation is suspende­d. He underlines the­ need for MLAs to be vigilant to pre­vent the influx of immigrants.

Pay channel blackout from Jan 6,"PATNA: Cable operators of Patna have decided to stop operations from 2 pm on January 6 for an indefinite period to protest the hike in pay channel subscriptions. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the Patna Cable TV Association here on Sunday. The association claims to have the support of around 250 cable operators, having a viewership of over 50,000. â€œThere will be a blackout after the India-Australia cricket match ends,â€� remarked association president Amit Prakash. According to the association, while the Star channel has hiked the subscription for its package from Rs 30 to Rs 45 per connection per month, the Zee package now comes for Rs 75 instead of earlier Rs 55. The Soni channel has also hiked its package fee from Rs 55 to Rs 65. Star Sports and ESPN have increased their subscriptions from Rs 32 to Rs 40, it said. The association is demanding withdrawal of the hikes introduced from this month. â€œHow can we provide services at Rs 150 per month per household when we have to spend Rs 300 on the subscriptions alone?â€� asked Prakash. He feared the city cable operators may have to do away with at least one package to make their operations viable. The association has also been demanding rationalisation of entertainment tax imposed by the state government on cable operators. At Rs 50 per connection annually, it is the highest in the country.

And it sure struck a chord with the audience, who only want to let their hair down and dance to the tunes. Saree Ke... | R...Rajkumar Sonakshi Sinha Set against a pristine white background of the Rann of Kutch, it’s a visual delight to watch Sonakshi and Shahid dance to Saree Ke Fall Sa. And Sonakshi’s neon pink stripe on her ghaghra and a neon yellow chunari really stand out in the white and blue background. When such are the visuals, who cares about the lyrics, eh?

Sree's family reacts angrily,"Not only did Gambhir called him a fixer but also alleged him to have come from the fixer family. Who others in our family are/were fixers,"" asked a family member of Sreeshant. She added, ""His ban had been reduced from life to seven years. He has been cleared now. What was the necessity to call him a fixer? The Supreme Court has an envelope having 13 names involved in corruption. The list has not been disclosed. We never know whether Gambhirs name is there in the 13. Sreesanth has been playing league matches. The organisers are aware of his innocence and then only include him in the team. People are aware about what painful journey he has undergone. The ban took away his livelihood. We wanted to live peacefully. Gambhir had no business calling him a fixer."" Serial fighter Gambhir got into a war of words with Shahid Afridi during the India vs. Pakistan match in Kanpur in 2007. Eventually an umpire had to intervene to end the altercation. The Delhi-based cricketer had a spat with Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal (over a caught behind catch appeal) during the Asia Cup match between India and Pakistan in Sri Lanka in 2010. The then captain MS Dhoni sorted out the matter. The former opening batsman lost his cool against Virat Kohli during an IPL match between KKR and RCB in 2013. The two players came disturbingly close to each other and exchanged a few words. Gambhir and Kohli were involved in another altercation in May 2023 in Lucknow. After the match, things got heated and players from both teams had to intervene to restore peace.","Not only did Gambhir called him a fixer but also alleged him to have come from the fixer family.

Few M&As in 2001; but many big-ticket deals,"The year 2001 witnessed a slowdown in the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, with fewer deals being announced and completed, compared to the previous year.

"Work stress could be reason for suicides in BSF, says study","A study conducted byBorder Security Force(BSF) suggests that the sentinels of the country’s borders are not living in very good conditions and are unhappy with certain facilities which could have helped reduce their occupational stress. This in turn could be leading to suicides/fratricides and personnel leaving the job without thinking about their future.Conducted byGyaneshwar Singh, second-in-command of 166th battalion at BSF’s North Bengal Frontier, the study looks at the level of occupational stress in the force due to non-operational factors (non-work stressors).“Occupational stress is impelling the personnel either to take the extreme step of suicide/fratricide to overcome the stress, or to leave the job without having any certainty about their future,” says the study, which has been approved by the top brass of BSF, the two lakh strong force which guards India’s borders with Pakistan andBangladesh.Talking about the trust deficit among senior command and lower ranks in the force, the BSF study says that there is a need to develop a culture of open expression and regular dialogue between the commanders and those under their command (jawans), “which is (presently) missing in the organisation”. It goes on to say that the present relationship in BSF between commanders and lower ranks is of “authoritarian” nature, which is a one way system.The research has looked at living conditions of jawans at the borders and other places of posting, their families, finances, and relationship with seniors to establish how these things lead to occupational stress.About the living barracks of jawans, the study says that around 43.7% of personnel have termed the conditions of living barracks (at places of posting) as ‘satisfactory,’ while 20.4% have said it is ‘bad’ and 4.8% claim it is ‘very bad’. Only 7.6 % BSF personnel have rated the living barracks as “very good” while 22.6 % have rated them as “good”.About 94.5% BSF personnel have stated that they need cleanliness in toilets, numbers of cots and fans increased at the barracks. The living conditions of jawans and the fact that they get less time to sleep adds to their woes and hence their motivational level is really affected, which further causes “stress”, it says. The command level officers interviewed by researchers agreed even though they make efforts to provide the basic amenities to the troops deployed on border but “there are always one or the other limitation”. “It is true that we haven’t been able to provide comfortable and healthy living conditions on border,” the senior officers admit.On whether the jawans are appreciated for their work or not, it says that 51% personnel feel that their work is not appreciated whle about 42% feel it is appreciated. “It is an important factor which has direct bearing on the motivation and morale. Some troops opine that the task assigned to them are fulfilled with great zeal and enthusiasm but no recognition is shown towards them,” the study says.Asserting that ‘family’ is the main non-operational factor which is the strongest ‘stressor’ for occupational stress in the force, the study says, “There are various issues related to family. It is not only the separation from the family but their well-being and settlement also raises a worry for the person who is deployed at border.” “…..the occupational stress has direct bearing on the productivity and motivation of the organisation.Moreover the lesser the motivation, the lesser is the commitment or the involvement which can also be termed as employee engagement,” study says, adding that “occupational stress which has now become a common phenomenon and a subject in discussion.”","A study conducted by the Border Security Force (BSF) indicates that BSF personnel are facing occupational stress due to various non-operational factors, which could be contributing to incidents of suicide, fratricide, and personnel leaving the job. The study highlights issues related to living conditions, a lack of appreciation for their work, and concerns about their families' well-being and settlement as significant stressors for BSF personnel. It also emphasizes the need for better living conditions, improved communication between commanders and lower ranks, and recognition for their efforts to address occupational stress in the force. The study's findings have been approved by the top brass of the BSF, which guards India's borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh.",Lifestyle and Features,2017-12-24 00:00:00

SC dismisses pleas to review Article 370 judgment,"A Bench of five judges headed by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud has dismissed multiple petitions seeking a review of a Supreme Court judgment upholding the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019. “Having perused the review petitions, there is no error apparent on the face of the record. No case for review under Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules 2013. The review petitions are, therefore, dismissed,” the Review Bench passed a short order recently. The Review Bench, besides the CJI, comprised Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B.R. Gavai, Surya Kant and A.S. Bopanna. A Constitution Bench had upheld the abrogation of Article 370, an event which had led to the reorganisation of the full-fledged State of Jammu and Kashmir to two union territories and denuding it of its special privileges. The judgment, in November 2023, had confirmed that the President could “unilaterally issue a notification that Article 370 ceases to exist”. The court had held that the President has power to abrogate Article 370 if “special circumstances warranted a special solution”. The court had said the abrogation of Article 370 was the culmination of a “gradual and collaborative exercise” spread over the past 70 years between the Centre and the State to integrate Jammu and Kashmir with the Union.","A five-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice of India D.Y.

Killer virus waiting to hit,"LUCKNOW: After SARS, Avian Influenza and deadly Aids virus scientists are now fearing the outbreak of another pandemic or killer influenza similar to the flu epidemic that killed millions of people worldwide in 1918. According to Prof David J Triggle from the University of Buffalo, the influenza virus keeps mutating and becoming more drug-resistant every year. Pharmacologists have to variate the composition of the Flu Shot or influenza vaccine each year in order to counter the new highly drug resilient strains of influenza. Another disturbing factor is that most of the antibiotics available in the market have already developed a drug resistance. Rampant misuse of antibiotics, self prescription and over-subscription in addition to pumping antibiotics in the food of poultry and animal livestock is responsible for non-responsiveness to antibiotics. He added that scientists today are battling against time in order to find new arenas and compounds for developing potent antibiotic targets as we are fast running out of effective antibiotic drugs. Faulty, unscientific farming practices have exacerbated the problem. ""China in fact is fast emerging as the ''factory for producing influenza''. This is primarily because China has a unique farming practice wherein pig and ducks are living in close proximity. The influenza virus ensures its existence by simply mutating each time it transfers itself from the pigs to the ducks to the chicken and so on,"" he said. He emphasised that it must be remembered that the deadly Aids virus was also first traced in the monkeys. It was only when it got transferred from the monkeys to human beings that it mutated into a much more virulent and killer form. ""We are constantly witnessing the spiking of certain ''mysterious diseases'' that wipe out a certain section of the susceptible populations and go largely uninvestigated and unreported. Earlier, since the disease was concentrated in a certain pocket it did not matter. In a global village with people constantly jet setting across the world the dangers are far more enhanced as the diseases are also easily crossing borders,"" he added.","Scientists, including Prof David J Triggle from the University of Buffalo, are expressing concerns about the potential outbreak of a new pandemic, similar to the deadly flu epidemic of 1918.

Compounding the problem is the widespread development of drug resistance in most antibiotics available on the market. Misuse, self-prescription, over-subscription, and the use of antibiotics in poultry and livestock contribute to this non-responsiveness. Faulty and unscientific farming practices, particularly in China, are identified as a major concern. The close proximity of pigs, ducks, and chickens in Chinese farming facilitates the influenza virus's continuous mutation. Prof Triggle emphasizes the need to find new compounds for potent antibiotic targets as effective antibiotic drugs are running out. He draws parallels with the emergence of the deadly AIDS virus, originally traced in monkeys and later mutating into a more virulent form in humans. In the interconnected global village, where diseases easily cross borders, the potential for uninvestigated and unreported mysterious diseases poses a significant threat.",Health and Wellness,2004-02-25 00:00:00

Sixth sense? Human beings can detect magnetic fields,"WASHINGTON: Humans may have a sixth sense after all, scientists have suggested, after finding that a protein in the human retina, when placed into fruit flies, has the ability to detect magnetic fields. The researchers from the University of Massachusetts Medical School, however, cautioned that whether or not humans use it in that way is not known. For the study, published in the journal Nature Communications , lead researcher Steven Reppert and his team carried out several experiments on wild fruit flies. The team replaced the cryptochromes of some fruit flies with the human version of the protein. They placed the flies into a T-shaped maze, with each arm equipped with a coil wrapped in such a way that when a current was sent through it, the coil became magnetized. The flies with the human cryptochromes showed sensitivity to the magnetic fields — either avoiding them as they might naturally do if, or showing a preference for the magnetised arm of the maze when trained with sugar rewards to go toward the magnetic field.","Researchers from the University of Massachusetts Medical School conducted experiments on wild fruit flies, replacing their cryptochromes with the human version of the protein.

Huge asteroid to fly close to earth on November 8,"COMMENTSSHARE Mark your calendars for November 8, because that’s when a massive asteroid will sweep past the Earth. The asteroid called 2005 YU55 has a diameter of 1,300 feet and will approach the planet at 0.85 lunar distances. Due the object’s size and whisking by so close to Earth, an extensive campaign of radar, visual and infrared observations is being planned. “The close Earth approach of 2005 YU55 on Nov. 8, is unusual since it is close and big. On average, one wouldn’t expect an object this big to pass this close but every 30 years,” Live Science quoted Don Yeomans, manager of NASA’s Near-Earth Object Program Office and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, as saying. Because of its size and proximity to Earth, the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Mass., has designated the space rock as a “potentially hazardous asteroid.” “This flyby will be the closest by any near-Earth asteroid with an absolute magnitude this bright since 1976 and until 2028,” said Lance Benner, a research scientist at JPL and a specialist on radar imaging of near-Earth objects. Initially, the object will be too close to the sun and too faint for optical observers. But late in the day (Universal Time) on Nov. 8, the solar elongation will grow sufficiently to see it. Early on Nov. 9, the asteroid could reach about 11th magnitude for several hours before it fades as its distance rapidly increases, Benner added.","On November 8, a large asteroid named 2005 YU55 will pass close to Earth, coming within 0.85 lunar distances. This event is significant due to the asteroid's size, measuring 1,300 feet in diameter, and its proximity to our planet. NASA plans to conduct extensive radar, visual, and infrared observations during the approach. While such close encounters are rare, they provide valuable opportunities for studying near-Earth objects. Despite initially being too faint to observe, the asteroid will become visible late on November 8 and early on November 9 before fading as it moves away from Earth.",Science and Technology,2011-05-03 00:00:00

A ray of hope in eradicating diarrhoea from India,"Every year nearly 11 children die every year before the age of five, due to disease that are easily preventable. In India itself more children under the age of five die as compared to any part of the world. Out of which diarrhoea has been the major cause of deaths amongst kids. Sad fact but very true. To overcome or combat this problem, UNICEF launched a 5 million USD programme in India on 3rd of April, 2013. The programme consists of providing zinc supplementation and oral rehydration therapy to prevent diarrhoea n young children. This programme will help to save over 150,000 children’s lives in India. The main aim of the programme is to treat diarrhoea and strengthen Indian health care system by up scaling the use of zinc supplementation and oral rehydration salts. In India, only 2 percent of children are accessible to zinc and ORS-which is cost-effective and life-saving mode of diarrhoea treatment. This new programme will help to save 150,000 children's lives over the course of the five-year programme, and 50,000 lives annually going forward, in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh alone. These three states accounts for the highest problem of childhood diarrhoea. Mr. David Morley- UNICEF Canada's President says - ""This new initiative exemplifies the considerable contributions corporate partnerships can make towards improving the lives of the world's most vulnerable children. UNICEF's partnership with Teck in India will provide strategic investments in proven interventions.” Besides, improving the health condition of children this programme will also help to educate health workers and communities while strengthening the local supply chain to ensure zinc and ORS are accessible and that achievements made over the next five years are sustainable in the long term. Mr. Doug Horswill-Senior Vice President at Teck says, ""In India, the number of children dying from diarrhoea, an illness that can be treated with zinc and ORS is particularly dire. As one of the world's largest producers of zinc, we have the ability and knowledge to help address this critical children's health issue.""","UNICEF launched a $5 million programme in India on April 3, 2013, aimed at preventing childhood deaths from easily preventable diseases.

Govt to crack whip on water theft,"While Arvind Kejriwal and his party leaders turned their free water dream into a reality in just three days of Government formation, the young CM will still have a lot of road to cover when it comes to solving water woes of the city. Kejriwal seems to have taken cognisance of the ‘other factors’ in DJB’s board meeting on Monday where he directed officials of the water utility to carry out sustained drives against unauthorised water connections. “Action will be taken against those who have unauthorised water connections. The CM also asked us to begin a widespread drive of installation of water meters,” said Sandeep Tanwar, member of DJB, while coming out of the DJB board meeting which was held at Kejriwal’s residence. Equitable water distribution will be a major challenge, at the same time Kejriwal will also have to focus on those 25 per cent of households which do not get piped water. Moreover, there are several areas like Sangam Vihar, Khanpur and lado Sarai village where even the free water tankers provided by DJB cannot reach, forget pipelines. Rampant mismanagement of water has been a serious issue over the years. Even now, nearly 50 per cent of potable water in Delhi is lost on account of leakages, theft and unequal distribution. A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India states that in areas without pipelines, the per capita supply of water is a meagre 3.28 litres per day against the prescribed 172 litres. Accepting the fact, a DJB official said, “About 80 per cent of households in Delhi get piped water supply. But it is also a fact that 50 per cent of the authorized water connections are not metered only.”","Arvind Kejriwal's swift implementation of free water faces challenges with unauthorised connections and unequal distribution.

Slightly less corrupt,"India's minor rise in corruption index must be welcomed but there is a long way yet to go The most significant thing about India’s rise — by three ranks — to the 78th position in Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index is the fact that the country has jumped past its bigger Eastern neighbour, China. In fact, the Middle Kingdom has dropped dramatically in the corruption rankings. Predictably, the communist media will dismiss the report but the fact is that under President Xi Jinping, who made fighting corruption a supposed cornerstone of his administration, the unscrupulous boomed thanks to projects like the Belt and Road Initiative. Corruption in China was just a stick used by Xi to eliminate his political rivals. However, India’s slight rise overtaking China is also a sign that under the Narendra Modi dispensation, there has been a palpable sense that large-scale political corruption reduced. This is not to say that every estate of the Indian state, including the fourth estate, the media, is riddled with scams. But as they say, we must take baby steps to start with. India’s problem is not just of corruption across the executive but that the malaise has taken root in society much like an invasive plant species and it is extremely difficult to remove it. The current state of Indian banks because of their profligate lending habits was in no small part due to questionable understanding between parties. Besides one has to understand that corruption is not always a case of money changing hands, it is also that network of favours. A job for a relative, school admission for a child, the worst forms of a corrupt system rarely involve money. Removing that will take years of work and a mindset change that everything, from chai-pani as the telephone lineman once asked for just to do his job to the payoffs for contracts, is wrong and that means teaching children at a very young age that corruption is bad. But in a country with an economic disparity as wide as that in India, eliminating corruption is almost impossible. That does not mean that we should not do our utmost to try and reduce it. There is little authentic economic data to prove this but rough calculations made by anti-corruption watchdogs show that we lose a percentage point or more of growth every year thanks to graft cases. Because it almost always benefits a few at the cost of the many. The poor municipal roads and potholes courtesy the a contractor ‘mafia’ in many cities are evidence of this. So yes, while we should be pleased with our rise and have a bit of schadenfreude about China's decline, we should not lose sight of the fact that the road ahead to reducing corruption is a long and a hard one.","India’s minor improvement in Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index, moving up to the 78th position, is notable, especially as it surpasses China. The article attributes India's progress to reduced large-scale political corruption under the Modi administration but acknowledges that corruption is deeply rooted in Indian society. It emphasizes that while the reduction of corruption is challenging and requires long-term efforts, including changing societal mindsets and teaching children about its detriments, the progress should be welcomed. The article concludes by stressing the significant impact of corruption on economic growth and the necessity of continued efforts to combat it.",Opinion and Editorial,2019-01-31 00:00:00

The world No4 decided that the pain in his elbow was too much and he?s out of the tournament. What a gimme for Berdych. He?s through to the semis.

Deep, penetrative hitting draws the error from Djokovic. Back on Centre Court, Raonic comes through deuce to hold for 5-4 in the third. Can he force a fourth set? 6.02pm BST 18:02 After a medical timeout, Novak Djokovic is ready for the second set on Court 1. He?d won 14 sets in a row against Tomas Berdych. Not a 15th, though. I wonder if he?ll suffer the kind of collapse we saw against Dominic Thiem in Paris? 6.00pm BST 18:00 Back on Centre Court, Milos Raonic has held and lost three break points in the eighth game of the third set. Federer saved them all and he ends up holding for 4-4 with a dreamy touch at the net. 5.59pm BST 17:59 First-set tie-break: Berdych* 7-2 Djokovic (*denotes server): Djokovic approaches the net, but Berdych does enough with a backhand down the line to force the Serbian to net a volley!

You feel he?s playing at his maximum, whereas Novak Djokovic can still go up a level or two. So it proves when Djokovic charges to deuce. Eventually Berdych holds. 5.37pm BST 17:37 After taking a rather lengthy toilet break after the second set, Milos Raonic is feeling more peppy and he earns his first break point in the second game of the third set. The unflappable Federer saves it with accurate serving and holds with an ace. 5.30pm BST 17:30 There?s no sign of a break on Court 1. It?s still on serve after seven games and Djokovic leads 4-3. 5.27pm BST 17:27 ?Any ideas on what?s happened to Milos? forehand?? says Michael Devine. ?It?s a completely different stroke in this match?high, looping topspins that sit up invitingly and land short, as opposed to his usual flat stroke.

Still, he?s dropping his forehands very short today and that?s asking for it against Federer, who?s giving it the treatment. 5.25pm BST 17:25 Federer earns three set points with an ace. This is preposterous. He pings a forehand into the left corner and Raonic nets a backhand. The Canadian?s surely not winning this one. 5.18pm BST 17:18 Here?s a report on Marin Cilic?s win by Simon Cambers. 5.15pm BST 17:15 Milos Raonic coolly saves two break points, but there?s no denying Roger Federer on the third. Another singing crosscourt backhand does the job as Raonic stretches and plants a volley wide for Federer to break again and lead 6-4, 4-1. I wonder if he?s after a spot of revenge after last year.Updated at 6.11pm BST 5.13pm BST 17:13 This is a masterclass from Roger Federer. They?re underway on Court 1, meanwhile. Can Berdych stun Djokovic? 5.02pm BST 17:02 Roger Federer earns a break point with a glorious backhand pass. Milos Raonic, desperate not to go for the Federer forehand, runs around a backhand and plonks a forehand a few yards wide to drop his serve in the opening game of set two. This doesn?t look it?s going to be an epic. 4.56pm BST 16:56 The sun breaks out from behind the clouds as Federer moves into a 30-0 lead, Raonic unable to do anything with a couple of returns. He swings a serve down the T to earn two set points. An ace down the middle, his fifth of the set, does the trick.Superb from Federer, who takes the first set 6-4.

Ball in Tata Sons’ court after Mistry decides to part ways,"The Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) group is in talks with several institutional investors to sell its 18.4% stake in Tata Sons Ltd if the Tata group fails to exercise its right to buy the shares first, two people directly aware of the development said. The move puts the onus on the Tata group to arrange the required funds to buy out the stake, which is estimated to be about ₹1.5 trillion. Given the challenging economic situation and the complexities of the transaction, it may well prove to be a tall task even for India’s biggest conglomerate. The SP group will have to offer the stake to Tata Sons first because the latter has the right of first refusal on the shares as per the company’s articles of association (AoA). After Cyrus Mistry’s ouster in 2016, Tata Sons had decided to convert itself from a public to private company. “Considering that the Tatas have the first right of refusal, the Mistry family would table these offers before Tata group, which are based on the current market value of the Tata Sons stake and may also entail some premium,” one of the two people cited above said on condition of anonymity. On Tuesday, the SP group, led by billionaire construction tycoon Pallonji Mistry, said it wanted to end its decades-long partnership with the Tatas following a bitter public feud between both parties after Cyrus Mistry was sacked. The Mistry family signalled its intention to sell the stake after Tata Sons blocked a move by the cash-strapped Mistry family to borrow funds by pledging its stake in Tata Sons. An email sent to the Mistry group spokesperson was not answered immediately. “There are restrictions in the articles of association of Tata Sons, which may prevent the SP group from selling its shares to a third party without first offering it to existing shareholders. There could be two issues arising here—structuring the transaction for acquiring the entire stake of SP group and the funding for the transaction,” said Nirav Shah, a partner at law firm DSK Legal. This will be a feasible solution for both groups who have been embroiled in a protracted legal battle. “However, the Tata group, even if it agrees to buy the stake, faces legal and financial hurdles,” said the second person cited above. “Tata Trusts cannot buy these shares directly as charitable trusts cannot acquire shares under law. If they want to buy, they would need a specific exemption from the government. The Tata group’s financially sound listed subsidiaries can, however, purchase these shares through a special resolution,” said a third person, a senior lawyer who requested anonymity. “Alternatively, Tata Sons can sell non-core assets and pledge the equity of its listed firms to raise debt,” he added. The other option is to get private equity or sovereign investors as a purely financial buyer, but even this option is tricky because of Tata Sons’s structure. “The other possibility is that SP group could sell a small portion of its stake to either Tata Sons or a third party, which would help it tide over its immediate cash crisis but it will mean that the stalemate will continue,” the third person said. Financial investors may not be interested in a direct stake in Tata Sons as exiting the position may become a problem, said a senior partner at a Big Four audit firm. “For PE firms, exits will be a question mark, and sovereign funds generally look for yields...So finding a financial buyer for the equity stake will be a challenge,” the person cited above said.","The Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) group is reportedly in talks with institutional investors to sell its 18.4% stake in Tata Sons Ltd if the Tata group declines to buy the shares first. The Tata group has the right of first refusal on the shares, making it essential for the SP group to offer the stake to Tata Sons first. The move puts the onus on the Tata group to arrange the required funds to buy out the stake, estimated to be around ₹1.5 trillion.

"US Guv, Google boss arrive in N Korea","Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt began a controversial private mission to North Korea on Monday that may include an effort to secure the release of an imprisoned American, the media reported. The trip comes after North Korea carried out a long range rocket test last month and as the reclusive state continues work on its nuclear testing facilities according to satellite imagery, potentially paving the way for a third nuclear bomb test. South Korean broadcaster MBC said the delegation comprising Schmidt, his daughter, Richardson and Google executive Jared Cohen were due to travel to Pyongyang from Beijing on North Korean state carrier Air Koryo. North Korea's KCNA state news agency later said they had arrived. It gave no details. The mission has been criticised by the White House due to the sensitivity of the timing.

LU to have new syllabi from next session in all courses,"LUCKNOW: Students of the Lucknow University will have a new syllabus in every stream from the next academic session. LU authorities have agreed to introduce in their curriculum, the â€œcommon syllabusâ€� recommended by the University Grantâ€™s Commission.The decision has been taken despite the opposition of the majority teachers, as there was a fear of loosing the UGC grants and aid for LU. However, efforts are being made to retain the â€œspecialisedâ€� and â€œtraditionalâ€� elements in the syllabi, along with the contents suggested by UGC. Dean, faculty of Arts, Prof Surendar Singh said that while there will be major changes in some subjects, in others, for which the syllabus was revised last year, there might not be much of a difference with the inclusion of the UGC format. The Science faculty dean, Prof HN Verma too believed that the new syllabus would effect minor changes and some â€œextraâ€� topics for the students. Dean, faculty of Commerce said that the teachers are deliberating the issue and he hoped that 50 per cent of the elements will remain the same as they are presently. In Law, the UGC format makes 83 lectures per subject compulsory, meaning extensive studies throug the year. While the faculty boards of Science and Arts had already approved the new â€œuniform syllabusâ€� format of UGC, the Commerce faculty has carried out the preliminary exercise of consulting the teachers and the proposals are expected to be approved soon. Similar is the case with the Law faculty, where the proposals have been prepared and will be tabled at the faculty board meeting to be held shortly. Plans are to table all these proposals (duly approved by all the faculty boards) at the academic council meeting slated for next month, for its final approval and the new syllabi will be included in the curriculum from the next academic session in all the subjects. The UGC in January, 2002, had come out with a â€œuniform syllabusâ€� for all subjects for universities across the country. The purpose was to have a countrywide uniformity in the university curriculum. However, it was opposed by teachers, who contended that every university has some speciality of its own in its syllabus, which make it different from others. They said by making the syllabi uniform, higher education would become like that of the board education followed till the high school and Inter level, wherein students all over the country have a similar curriculum. The issue was also raised at the Vice-Chancellorsâ€™ conference held earlier this year. Since there was a threat of loosing the UGC grant and no financial help was coming from the state government, all the state universities resolved to adopt the UGC syllabus along with their traditional USPs.","Lucknow University will adopt a new syllabus from the next academic session, following the University Grants Commission’s (UGC) recommendation for a ""common syllabus."" Despite opposition from many faculty members, the university decided to implement this change to avoid losing UGC grants. The new syllabus will integrate UGC content while maintaining specialized and traditional elements. Faculties have approved the changes, with final approval expected at the academic council meeting next month. The UGC aims for uniformity across universities, though some argue it diminishes individual university uniqueness.",Education,2002-08-31 00:00:00

PM Modi accuses congress of advocating for separating Karnataka from India,"THE ASIAN AGE WITH AGENCY INPUTS Published : May 8, 2023, 10:16 pm IST Updated : May 8, 2023, 10:16 pm IST Mr Modi held a massive roadshow in Bengaluru Prime Minister and senior BJP leader Narendra Modi addressed a public meeting ahead of Karnataka Assembly elections, at Nanjanagudu in Mysuru district, Sunday. (Photo: PTI) Bengaluru: In a blistering attack on the Congress during his last campaign rally in Mysuru district ahead of the May 10 Assembly polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday accused the party of openly advocating for ""separating"" Karnataka from India. He alleged that the ""disease"" of the ""tukde-tukde gang"" had reached the Congress' top level. Targeting the BJPâs arch-rival in the impending elections, the Prime Minister at the Shivamogga rally said the ""scared"" Congress brought in its veteran leader Sonia Gandhi for campaigning in the Karnataka elections after its ""lies did not work"". Earlier in the day, Mr Modi held a massive roadshow in Bengaluru and interacted with members of the Hakki Pikki tribe, who were evacuated from Sudan under Operation Kaveri, in Shivamogga. Addressing a public meeting in Mysuru district, Mr Modi claimed, ""When it comes to working against India's interests, Congress' 'royal family' will be at the forefront. I want to speak about a serious issue here... I want to say it because there is a lot of pain in my heart. This country can never forgive such a game. This family, to influence the politics in the country, is encouraging foreign forces to interfere."" Continuing his attack, Mr Modi accused the Congress leaders of secretly meeting foreign diplomats who hate India and repeatedly indulging in activities that insult India's sovereignty, adding, ""they were not ashamed of it"". Stating that in this Karnataka election, the Congress' ""shahi parivar"" had gone a step ahead ""breaking all the limits and crushing the feelings of the country"", Mr Modi said, ""not only Karnataka, I want to tell this to the entire country with a lot of pain that in this election Congress' 'shahi parivar' yesterday came to Karnataka and said that they want to protect the ""sovereignty"" of Karnataka. ""Karnataka's sovereignty -- you know what is the meaning of it? They have sat in Parliament for so many years, they have taken oaths on India's Constitution, and they say this... When a country becomes Independent, it is called a sovereign country. The meaning of what Congress is saying is that the Congress believes that Karnataka is separate from India,"" he said, without taking any names. Asking people whether they approved of it and whether they would punish the Congress for such a statement, the Prime Minister said, ""It meant that the Congress was openly advocating for separating Karnataka from India."" ""I had never thought that the disease of the tukde-tukde gang would reach the Congress' top level,"" he said, accusing the party of insulting Kannada fighters who fought for India's Independence and insulting the patriotism of crores of Kannadigas. Noting that this was the land where ""Rashtra Kavi"" Kuvempu had said Karnataka was an integral part of India with the lines in the state anthem, ""Jaya Bharata Jananiya Tanujate Jaya he Karnataka Maate"", Mr Modi said, ""For every Kannadiga, Karnataka is a mother and she has been described as the daughter of 'Bharat ma'. I can feel the feelings of Kannadigas."" Insulting the feelings of Karnataka was like insulting the ""culture and pride"" of the state, he added. Â At an election rally in Shivamogga, Mr Modi, without taking the name of Mrs Gandhi, said, ""Now, the Congress is so afraid and scared that when their lies did not work, then those who are not taking part in campaigning are being brought here. The Congress has started dumping the responsibility of defeat on each other."" On Saturday, Mrs Gandhi, who has largely stayed away from campaigning and public rallies since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls reportedly due to health reasons, addressed her first election meeting in Karnataka, which votes on May 10. The Prime Minister also said that the Congress' ""balloon of lies is no longer working as people have burst it"". As Mr Modi was presented a Hanuman idol and a saffron-colored ""Shivaji"" turban, the crowd roared with ""Jai Sri Ram"" (Hail Lord Ram) chants while the Prime Minister raised ""Bajrang Bali Ki Jai"" (Hail Hanuman) slogans. The Prime Minister said that he was touched by the overwhelming response to his roadshow held in Bengaluru earlier on Sunday. ""It was supposed to be a long roadshow, but due to the NEET exam, I told our party that our exam (election) is on May 10, whereas the children's exam is today. Hence, we should take care of their exams. So, we did a roadshow in the morning and finished it early,"" he said. Mr Modi said that despite being a Sunday, the strength Bengaluru displayed, the faith it reposed and the love it demonstrated touched his heart and he will be indebted to Karnataka. The Prime Minister said he wanted to pay back the love and blessings showered on him by the people. ""I want to give you the original guarantee for your love and blessings; I will develop Karnataka and refund your love with interest,"" he said. In Bengaluru, a day before the final day of campaigning for the May 10 Assembly polls in Karnataka, the Prime Minister held a massive roadshow in the city, waving at a large number of enthusiastic crowds lined up on both sides of the 8 km route from Kempegowda statue at New Thippasandra Road to Trinity Circle. The roadshow that began with Mr Modi paying floral tributes to the statue of Kempegowda (the founder of Bengaluru) passed through parts of east and central Bengaluru, touching about half-a-dozen Assembly segments. The Prime Minister was accompanied in the specially designed vehicle by Union minister of state Rajeev Chandrasekhar, who is a Rajya Sabha member from Karnataka and Bengaluru Central MP P.C. Mohan. At the Trinity Circle, where the roadshow culminated, Mr Modi repeatedly bowed with folded hands to the large crowd gathered there, amid loud cheers. In Shivamogga, the Prime Minister interacted with members of the Hakki Pikki tribe, who were evacuated from Sudan. The evacuees profusely thanked the Prime Minister for the proactive steps taken by the government to ensure their timely and safe evacuation. They recounted the tough circumstances they faced in Sudan and how the government and Indian embassy ensured their safety. The Prime Minister recalled how the forefathers of the community members stood alongside Maharana Pratap. He said that if any Indian anywhere in the world was in any kind of difficulty, the government would not rest until the problem was resolved. ""Some politicians tried to politicise the issue, and our concern was that if they expose where Indians are hidden, they may face greater danger. So the government worked quietly to ensure everyone's safety,"" Mr Modi was quoted as saying. The Prime Minister asked them to remember the strength of the country that has stood up for them and always be ready to help those in trouble and contribute to society and the country. end-of Tags: prime minister narendra modi, sonia gandhi, tukde-tukde gang, operation kaveri Location: India, Delhi, New Delhi Latest From India Modi to get Shiv Sanman Puraskar on February 19 Budget: Tax relief unlikely, sops for untapped sectors Modi Slams Opposition MPs for Disrupting Parliament President Murmu says Ram Mandir, eco reforms key achievements","Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the Congress party of advocating for the separation of Karnataka from India during his last campaign rally ahead of the Karnataka Assembly elections.

Egyptian army sides with Mubarak; tensions rise,"The Egyptian military called Wednesday for an end to more than a week of demonstrations against President Hosni Mubarak, throwing its support behind his embattled regime hours after he defiantly rejected demands to step down immediately and said he would serve out his term in office. The declaration was a clear shift in the stand of the army, which gave a tacit endorsement to the movement on Monday by saying it would not use force against protesters, and that they had legitimate demands. Several thousand pro-Mubarak demonstrators held marches and protests around Cairo, raising the danger of clashes with anti-government protesters. The Mediterranean city of Alexandria saw fighting erupt between several hundred protesters and government supporters early Wednesday after Mubarak spoke, Al-Jazeera television footage showed. Protesters formed a human chain at the northern end of Cairo's main square between the pro-Mubarak protesters and several thousand people calling for the president's ouster. Traffic barriers and an army personnel carrier also stood between the two sides in the square, the epicenter of the protests against Mubarak.","On Wednesday, the Egyptian military called for an end to protests against President Hosni Mubarak, showing support for his regime after he refused to step down immediately.

"AAPBSU opposes ABK, AdiSU move","ITANAGAR, May 1: All Arunachal Pradesh Border Student’s Union (AAPBSU) has appealed to both ABK and AdiSU to drop its demand for recognition of Arunachal Mishing tribe as Adis. Supporting the objection raised by All Arunachal Pradesh Students Union to the demands of ABK and AdiSU, the AAPBSU said it is not agree with the demand of the ABK. The Mishing tribe has already got ST status in Assam and therefore granting them ST status in Arunachal does not arise, it said. Before raising such demand, ABK and AdiSU should think about the indigenous people of the state and growing unemployment problems, AAPBSU said. When Arunachal-Assam boundary problem yet is to be solved, such demand will encourage influx of neighbouring people in the state, it added.","The All Arunachal Pradesh Border Student’s Union (AAPBSU) has urged both the Adi Students' Union (AdiSU) and the Adi Baane Kebang (ABK) to withdraw their demand for recognizing the Arunachal Mishing tribe as Adis.

Joint committee of MPs sought to improve rail connectivity between western and southern T.N.,"READ LATER The Coimbatore Development Council has mooted a proposal to form a joint committee of MPs of western and southern Tamil Nadu to restore train services between both the regions. J. Sathish, convenor of the council, has reiterated the need for the joint committee to pressurise the Chairman of Railway Board and the Ministry of Railways to restore the rail connectivity. Coimbatore Development Council is a body drawn up of individuals from various associations and will act as a lobbying group for the infrastructure needs. With the support of Kongu Global Forum and Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the council convened a meeting in September 2021 seeking petitions on the infrastructure needs, he said. “We are in the process of collecting petitions, consolidating them and the process of writing to the MPs has begun and already some MPs have been approached. The council would shortly get in touch with the MPs and bring them under one umbrella”, Mr. Sathish said. “A joint committee of 15 MPs is a must, as petitions to the Divisional Railway Manager and the General Managers finally await a nod from the Railway Board,” he said. The MPs of Coimbatore, the Nilgiris, Pollachi, Tiruppur, Erode, Namakkal, Karur, Dindigul, Madurai, Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Tenkasi, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari Lok Sabha constituencies would be approached for the joint committee, he said. “It is regrettable that the train connectivity from the western districts to southern Tamil Nadu is very poor. There were eight trains daily from Coimbatore to Madurai, Rameswaram, Thoothukudi, Tiruchendur Nagercoil, Kollam and a few other places via Pollachi earlier and it was stopped due to gauge conversion in this section, a decade ago. After spending ₹300 crore on gauge conversion works, the Southern Railway, particularly the Palakkad Railway Division, was not keen on restoring the trains. All the eight train services must be restored in this sector,"" Mr. Sathish added. The 23-km-long railway line from Kinathukadavu to Pollachi should be reconstituted in the Salem Division from Palakkad Division for more operational benefits. A railway line from Coimbatore to Karur via Chettipalayam, Palladam, Pongalur, Kangeyam, Vellakovil and Paramathi will further improve rail connectivity in the region, Mr. Sathish said. Coimbatore MP P.R. Natarajan said that if the issue was brought to his notice, he will certainly do the needful. Tiruppur MP K. Subbarayan said that given the approach that the Centre takes towards the needs of Tamil Nadu, he was apprehensive of the outcome. However, he added that he was in favour of the proposal to pressurise the Railway Ministry and the Railway Board.","The Coimbatore Development Council has proposed the formation of a joint committee of Members of Parliament (MPs) from western and southern Tamil Nadu to advocate for the restoration of train services between these regions.

Solar energy needs bigger breakthrough,"India can easily become a world leader in solar energy. Our current solar power installed capacity is around 3 GW, which is 0.5% of the estimated potential In a big push to encourage energy efficient measures, especially rooftop solar power generation, India’s first rooftop solar plant on a carport at a commercial mall ‘Unity One’ in Rohini was inaugurated recently. Tata Power Delhi Distribution and Tata Power Solar have jointly executed the 300 KW plant. This first of its kind plant which is expected to generate 4,20,000 units of green energy annually will empower the complex’s day-to-day operations meeting 80 per cent of its electricity demand, while reducing the carbon footprint of around 438 metric tonnes (MT) every year. The plant will help ‘Unity Mall’ save of Rs 50 lakh annually on electricity bill and Rs 12 crore over the entire plant life. The initiative is in line with climate change agenda for Delhi and the ‘National Solar Mission’ and is set up as part of ‘National Action Plan on Climate Change’ (NAPCC). The grid-connected, rooftop-based PV power plants supervised by Tata Power-DDl have a life span of 25 years, wherein 1KW of PV power plant will generate up to 1,400 units in a year. Consumers and institutions can also sell the surplus power generated to the Discom, and attain breakeven on investment in five years. This initiative though commendable still pales in front of the tremendous progress made by solar energy in many parts of the world and for that matter in many other cities of India as well. The National Solar Mission, which aims to establish India as a global leader in solar energy, has a long way to go before the objective is achieved. India is in a unique position to extract the full advantage of alternative sources of energy such as solar power. Given the huge population and the consequent pressure on natural resources, particularly energy-India can set new milestones in the manner in which solar energy can be innovatively and thoroughly be used to cater to the burgeoning energy demand. India’s current solar power installed capacity is around 3 GW, which is 0.5% of the estimated potential. Naturally there exists a massive opportunity to tap this potential and with the right policies in place backed by efficient implementation, India can easily become a world leader in solar energy. This solar endeavor could also help address acute power shortages, and make a real difference in slowing the pace of climate change. A green energy revolution is needed in India that can increase prosperity for millions of poor families by harnessing the abundant and clean energy of the sun and since being elected in May 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has strived to achieve the same by aiming to increasing India's renewable energy capacity five-fold from 30 gigawatts to 175 gigawatts, including a boost in solar power generation from 20 GW to 100 GW. The plan is to achieve these targets by 2022. India's ambitious solar energy plans can only see the light of the day if they are backed by a national energy policy, regulatory programs and innovative financing mechanisms that encourage the development of distributed energy, particularly applications that combine solar generation with efficient energy storage solutions. As a first step towards this, India must invite solar energy experts and developers so that the revised targets of 100 GW of solar and 75 MW of wind by 2022 and beyond are successfully met. Additionally, the government must expedite renewable energy powered public transportation, the current pace of initiatives are simply not enough to get a breakthrough needed. The use of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, and deployment of solar-powered EV charging stations around the country need to be stepped up. Moreover, development and implementation of""time-of-day"" pricing must be applied which will encourage charging of vehicles at night and other times when peak demand is low. These measures coupled with zero-emission battery-powered electric buses in all major cities will not only reduce air pollution but also help reverse climate change. The government must also focus on providing innovative financing solutions such as tax-free solar bonds or green infrastructure bonds to acceleratethe access to credit at globally competitive rates. This will instill more confidence from potential investors and decrease the cost of financing for renewable energy projects. Similarly, large-scale ""Solar Manufacturing Hubs"" also need to be developed in India to facilitate mass production of solar energy equipment at competitive costs.Thanks to the drive shown by the present government, India is standing on the threshold of a green energy revolution that can light up a new era of energy, economic and environmental security. But to achieve this goal India needs a breakthroughin how it produces, distributes and consumes energy. If India gets this right, the dependence on fossil fuels can be ended besides creating millions of new jobs.","India has taken strides towards becoming a global leader in solar energy, with recent initiatives like the inauguration of a 300 KW rooftop solar plant at Unity One mall in Rohini, Delhi. This project, executed by Tata Power Delhi Distribution and Tata Power Solar, is expected to generate 420,000 units of green energy annually, meeting 80% of the mall's electricity demand and reducing carbon footprint by 438 metric tonnes yearly. It aligns with Delhi's climate change agenda and the National Solar Mission under the National Action Plan on Climate Change. Despite progress, India's current solar capacity of 3 GW represents only 0.5% of its potential, highlighting significant growth opportunities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi aims to increase solar capacity to 100 GW by 2022, requiring robust policies, regulatory frameworks, innovative financing, and infrastructure development to achieve these ambitious goals.",Science and Technology,2017-11-30 00:00:00

West Bengal govt invites protesting doctors for talks after withdrawal of fast,"Hours after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee urged junior doctors protesting the rape and murder of their colleague at R G Kar Hospital to end their fast-unto-death, the state government invited the medics for talks on Monday, conditional upon the “withdrawal of their hunger strike”. However, earlier in the day, the agitating doctors had declined to end their fast until all of their demands were met. In a letter addressed to the junior doctors on Saturday evening, West Bengal Chief Secretary Manoj Pant invited them for talks on Monday at 5 pm. Pant stated that most of the doctors’ demands had already been addressed.“The Hon’ble chief minister hopes that this message will be received with the understanding that the junior doctors will immediately end the hunger strike in the interest of public health and well-being. All the points raised by you have been discussed and responded to,” Pant said in the letter. He added, “However, as per your request, if you wish to further discuss these points, you are invited for a meeting with the chief minister on October 21, Monday, at 5 pm in Nabanna Sabhaghar, with 10 of your colleagues, after the withdrawal of the hunger strike.”Pant also mentioned that the meeting is scheduled to last 45 minutes only. Banerjee on Saturday urged the junior doctors to end their fast-unto-death, asserting that most of their demands had already been addressed, though she rejected their insistence on removing the state Health secretary. Speaking to the doctors over the phone during the visit of chief secretary Manoj Pant and Home secretary Nandini Chakraborty to the protest site in Esplanade this afternoon, Banerjee said, “Everybody has the right to protest, but it shouldn’t affect healthcare services. I would request you all to withdraw your fast.” The junior doctors are demanding the removal of state Health secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam, in addition to other reforms. In response, Banerjee acknowledged their frustration but said, “You know why I did not remove the Health secretary. It is not possible to remove everyone in a department at once. We had earlier removed the DHS and DME. Please rise above politics and rejoin work.” “How can you decide which officer will be removed or not? Is this logical?” she asked. The junior doctors have been on a fast-unto-death for the past 15 days, demanding justice for their deceased colleague and calling for systemic changes in the state’s healthcare infrastructure. So far, six doctors on hunger strike have been hospitalised due to deteriorating health, while eight others continue their indefinite fast, insisting that the state government take concrete action by October 21 to resolve the deadlock.","West Bengal's state government has invited junior doctors to talks on Monday, conditional upon the withdrawal of their hunger strike.

COP28 seals deal on fossil fuels,"Dubai: Nearly 200 countries on Wednesday clinched a deal that called for a ""transition away from fossil fuels,"" the primary reason for the planet's climate crisis, at the UN climate summit here, a development described as ""landmark"" by negotiators but criticised by several activists for its lack of clarity. The words ""fossil fuel"" became part of the final document of the first Global Stocktake deal, being termed the UAE consensus, at the COP28 for the first time in almost three decades of such negotiations, which called for its transition in a ""just and equitable"" manner. Adopted after nearly two weeks of hectic negotiations, it urges countries to accelerate efforts toward the phase-down of unabated coal power, which is a climb down after India and China strongly resisted the singling out of coal. As COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber gavelled through the agreement, the room full of negotiators at the annual Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) burst into applause. Addressing the closing plenary of the COP28, Environment Minister Bhupendra Yadav said the collective efforts here have sent positive signals to the world in reinforcing commitment to maintaining the temperature goals set in Paris. ""The way ahead must be based on equity and climate justice, let us implement the Paris Agreement in letter and spirit through the Global Stocktake process,"" he said. The text of the Dubai climate talks calls for a deep, rapid, and sustained reduction in planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5 degree Celsius pathways in a ""nationally determined"" manner, taking into account the Paris Agreement and their different national circumstances, pathways, and approaches. The historic document called on countries with an eight-point plan to achieve this. It includes a ""transition away from fossil fuels"" in energy systems in a ""just, orderly and equitable manner,"" accelerating action in this decade, to achieve net zero (balance between greenhouse gases emitted and removed from the atmosphere) by 2050. It also urged countries to accelerate efforts toward the phase down of unabated coal power, a marginal step up from the 2021 Glasgow deal. However, unlike the previous versions, it lacks references to limiting the permitting of new and unabated coal power generation. This absence suggests a strong pushback from heavily coal-dependent countries such as India and China. Also, there is no mention of oil and gas in the 21-page document, fuels that rich countries continue to use. US Climate Envoy John Kerry said the US along with China, will update their long-term strategies on pathways to net zero emissions by 2050, and encouraged other countries to do the same. Graham Stuart, the UK's climate change minister, said this is the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era. ""We've heard from the small island states and we understand their concerns. The voices of the islands must be heard,"" he said. India's neighbours -- Pakistan and Bangladesh -- also spoke at the closing plenary and welcomed the adoption of the landmark agreement. Addressing the gathering after adopting the agreement, Sultan al-Jaber said this is a robust action plan which plans to keep 1.5 degrees within reach. Avinash Persaud, Special Climate Envoy to Prime Minister Mottley of Barbados, said when the dust settles and dawn breaks, this will be seen as one of the most historic COPs. ""We have operationalised a loss and damage fund, recapitalised the Green Climate Fund, and orchestrated an international climate finance system that prepares for new levies alongside emboldened development banks and new private sector flows. Today, we have committed to triple renewable investments and have a just transition from fossil fuels,"" he said. Noting that some parties opposed a clear reference to phase out of fossil fuels during the COP28, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in his post on X, said: ""Fossil fuel phase out is inevitable."" Ajay Mathur, Director General, International Solar Alliance, said the developments in Dubai further underscore the imperative to transition towards renewable energy for achieving Net Zero emissions. Sanjay Vashist, Director, Climate Action Network South Asia, said, ""We cannot celebrate the mere inclusion of the reference to fossil fuels in the text if it comes without means of implementation and finance for energy transition for poor and developing countries."" Dr Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of Council for Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said the COP decision hasn't held historical polluters accountable, or established effective mechanisms to finance climate resilience and a just low-carbon transition for the Global South. ""The Global Stocktake's final text lacked the candid acknowledgement of problems and the teeth required to fight them."" Madhura Joshi, India Lead at independent climate change think tank E3G said, ""Though, there are several contradictions, the first Global Stocktake leaves the door open for low-carbon/emission technologies and transition fuels that have the potential to delay action and lock-in resources.""","At the UN climate summit in Dubai, nearly 200 countries reached a ""landmark"" deal, known as the UAE consensus, calling for a ""transition away from fossil fuels"" for the first time. The agreement, part of the Global Stocktake deal, urged countries to accelerate efforts toward the phase-down of unabated coal power. However, it lacked references to limiting new and unabated coal power generation and did not mention oil and gas. Critics argue that it lacks clarity and meaningful means of implementation and finance for energy transition in developing countries. The agreement aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.",International News,2023-12-14 00:00:00
Myriad woes: On Myanmar’s war within,"Myanmar’s military did it again. On Tuesday, the junta, notorious for its attacks on civilians, carried out air strikes on an opposition gathering in the rebel-held Sagaing region, killing over 100, including women and children. The National Unity Government (NUG), the parallel administration formed by opposition groups, as well as witnesses, said a fighter jet and a combat helicopter bombed the gathering, which was celebrating the opening of an administrative office of the NUG; the regime, led by Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, calls it a “terrorist entity”. The junta later confirmed the strike, but said most of those killed were resistance fighters. The strikes actually show the junta’s growing vulnerabilities rather than strength in the country’s ongoing civil war. In the past, the main opposition that the military regimes had faced was the non- violent democratic movement led by Aung San Suu Kyi. But after the February 2021 coup, which toppled an increasingly popular Ms. Suu Kyi (her National League for Democracy had won back-to-back elections), the country slipped into a civil war between the regime and the NUG. The NUG and its armed wing, the People’s Defence Force (PDF), have joined hands with ethnic militias to oust the military. The military has lost swathes of territories, mostly sparsely populated rural and jungle areas. Unable to recapture lost land, it has relied on air strikes to weaken the opposition. The junta faces pressure from the resistance groups, but it still controls most of the country’s population centres. The current approach of the generals is to hold on to territories under their control while continuing to use disproportionate force against opposition fighters and civilians in rebel-held areas. With the tacit support of Russia and China and silence from India, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing does not face any regional pressure either. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) had earlier proposed a five-point peace plan, urging an end to hostilities and starting inclusive dialogue. But the generals have refused to talk to the opposition and are not ready to share power. The status quo, however, is unsustainable. Regional powers cannot look away when a thuggish regime keeps killing its people with impunity. A peaceful resolution in Myanmar is essential for the stability of Southeast Asia, and, hence, ASEAN and regional powers such as Russia, China and India should not see the civil strife as an internal problem of Myanmar. They should use their economic and political clout to force the generals to stop the violence and enter into talks with the opposition. The only sustainable, long-term and just solution for Myanmar’s myriad woes is the restoration of its democracy under a federal constitutional order. The first step to achieve this goal is to end the violence.","Myanmar's military junta conducted air strikes on an opposition gathering in Sagaing, killing over 100, including women and children. The strikes reveal the junta's growing vulnerabilities in the ongoing civil war. After the 2021 coup, the opposition, led by the National Unity Government (NUG) and armed wing People's Defence Force, joined ethnic militias against the military. The junta, unable to recapture lost territories, relies on air strikes. While facing pressure, it still controls population centers, supported by Russia and China. Regional powers, including India, should intervene, using economic and political influence to push for talks and a peaceful resolution, essential for Southeast Asia's stability. The call is for an end to violence and the restoration of Myanmar's democracy under a federal constitutional order.",International News,2023-04-15 00:00:00

"In Big Push For Mother Tongue Education, Early Schooling In 52 Languages","NEW DELHI: In a landmark initiative to promote learning in Indian languages, the Centre on Saturday launched schooling, especially for early childhood, in 52 non-scheduled Indian languages which include 17 tribal languages. In this major push for education in mother tongue, school students from different parts of the country will now be getting access to education in their native language.","The initiative to introduce early schooling in 52 languages represents a significant step towards promoting mother tongue education and preserving linguistic diversity in India. Here are some key points about this initiative: 1. **Preservation of Cultural Heritage**: By offering early schooling in 52 languages, the initiative aims to preserve and promote India's rich linguistic and cultural heritage. Mother tongue education not only helps children develop strong foundational skills but also fosters a sense of identity and belonging to their cultural roots. 2. **Enhanced Learning Outcomes**: Research has shown that children learn best when they are taught in their mother tongue or a language they are familiar with. Introducing early schooling in diverse languages can lead to better learning outcomes, improved cognitive development, and increased engagement in the classroom. 3. **Inclusive Education**: Providing education in multiple languages ensures that children from diverse linguistic backgrounds have access to quality education. It promotes inclusivity and equity by catering to the linguistic needs of all students, regardless of their mother tongue. 4. **Promotion of Multilingualism**: Early exposure to multiple languages encourages the development of multilingual skills, which are increasingly valuable in today's globalized world. It equips children with the linguistic and cultural competencies needed to navigate diverse social and professional environments. 5. **Empowerment of Indigenous Communities**: Introducing early schooling in indigenous languages empowers marginalized and indigenous communities by valuing and preserving their languages and knowledge systems. It helps bridge the gap between formal education and indigenous knowledge, promoting cultural pride and self-determination. Overall, the initiative to introduce early schooling in 52 languages reflects a commitment to promoting linguistic diversity, inclusive education, and cultural preservation in India's education system. It has the potential to positively impact the educational experiences and opportunities available to millions of children across the country.",Education,2024-03-10 00:00:00

India authorised to certify measuring and weighing instruments as per global standard; boost for exports,"India has become the 13th country authorised to certify 'measuring and weighing instruments' based on globally accepted standards of the Paris-based IOLM, a development that will boost domestic exports of such products. An IOLM-approved certificate is mandatory to sell weighing or measuring instruments in the international market at present. The International Organization of Legal Metrology (IOLM), established in 1955, is an intergovernmental organization that develops model regulations and standards for use by legal metrology authorities and industry. India became a member in 1956. ""Recently, we were offered to become an IOLM certificate issuing authority. We are now the 13th country in the world to be authorized for issuing OIML approval certificates,"" Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh told reporters. Other countries are: Australia, Switzerland, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, France, United Kingdom, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, and Slovakia, he said.The official also mentioned that a separate division in the ministry will be set up to look into IOLM certification. To begin with, a laboratory will also be established at Ahmedabad, Gujarat for testing initially eight sets of instruments like energy meters, water meters, automatic and manual weighting machines, etc., he said. Gradually, the number of labs will be increased. The certification fee in India will be lesser than in other countries, he added. Stating that this will help boost domestic exports, the secretary said indigenous manufacturers were facing delays in getting the IOLM certificates from other countries. ""They were facing long queue and delay in visas. These problems will be addressed now as they can get the IOLM certification in India itself at a lesser cost,"" he said. Domestic manufacturers can now export their weighing and measuring instruments worldwide without incurring additional testing fees, resulting in significant cost savings. Singh said the country exported Rs 600 crore worth of measuring instruments in the last three years. The exports will rise further with India becoming an IOLM certificate-issuing nation. Besides, India can also support foreign manufacturers by issuing IOLM pattern approval certificates from its certified RRSLs, thereby generating forex in terms of fees, etc., he added. The country follows IOLM recommendations and procedures for testing and calibration of weights and measures. The reports prepared by the Legal Metrology's Regional Reference Standards Laboratories are now acceptable to the IOLM issuing authorities. Paul Dixon, Executive Secretary, IOLM-CS, who also joined from Paris headquarters, reaffirmed India's role as an IOLM Certificates Issuing Authority and assured continued cooperation.","India has been granted authorization to certify ""measuring and weighing instruments"" in accordance with standards set by the International Organisation of Legal Metrology (IOLM), making it the thirteenth nation to do so. To sell weighing or measuring instruments on the global market, a certificate must be IOLM-approved. This initiative will increase the number of such products exported domestically and assist Indian firms in cutting costs and avoiding delays caused by getting certificates from foreign nations. In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, a new division and laboratory for IOLM certification will be established, first concentrating on energy metres, water metres, and weighing equipment.",Miscellaneous,2023-09-14 00:00:00
Barnala bails out govt,"NEW DELHI, Dec 4 — The Vajpayee government came close to facing a trial of strength in the Lok Sabha today but an abrupt adjournment of the House, 15 minutes before lunch recess, by the Speaker, Mr G.M.C. Balayogi, saved the day for the government. The entire Opposition, including the Congress and non-Congress parties, who were apparently in larger numbers than the ruling side, sprang a surprise on the BJP-led coalition when they pressed for a division on BJP member Shyam Bihari Mishra’s motion that the time for presentation of the joint committee report on the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 1998, be extended up to the last day of the winter session. The House had to be adjourned twice again amidst noisy scenes with the Opposition sticking to their demand. The issue was finally resolved with the Speaker, Mr Balayogi, thrashing out the matter at an hour-long meeting with leaders of political parties in his chamber. The government was bailed out of the embarrassing situation by the Union Food Minister, Mr Surjit Singh Barnala, who announced that a comprehensive Bill on essential commodities providing stringent measures against hoarders would be introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 9. The Opposition, thereafter, did not press for voting, bringing relief to the treasury benches. Mr Barnala recalled the unanimous decision at the Chief Ministers’ conference last week that the Act should be amended to include edible oils and vegetables under its purview. He said the conference also decided to empower the state governments to take effective action against blackmarketeers and hoarders. Earlier, when the Opposition insisted on voting, a rattled Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr Madan Lal Khurana, sought to defer a decision on the issue. A determined Opposition, however, vociferously turned down the suggestion. The Speaker at this juncture ruled that he would call a meeting of the leaders of political parties in his chamber to decide the issue. This was vehemently rejected by the Opposition. Members of the Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Left parties were on their feet demanding a vote on the motion. The Speaker tried to push through the motion by putting it to voice vote but the Opposition was in no mood to relent. It insisted that it was opposed to the extension of the House committee. Almost the entire Opposition demanded a division. Congress member Rajesh Pilot said there was no point in giving an extension to the committee for presentation of the report and the amendment should be withdrawn. He pointed out that the Union Food Minister had brought forward the amendment Bill in the last session which was strongly opposed by the Opposition and later sent to the joint committee. The Congress Chief Whip, Mr P.J. Kurien, said since the motion was put to vote by the Chair, there was no other way out but to go in for division. Mr Kurien was supported by members of the RJD and the Left parties. Former Speaker P.A. Sangma quoted the rule book to say that there was no other option but to go in for a division. Mr Khurana argued that the joint committee had been constituted by the Speaker who now wanted an extension. The Minister said he had written to the Speaker that no further extension be given to the committee. If the Speaker desired, the government was willing to withdraw the Bill, he added. The BJP’s allies, including the Telegu Desam and the Shiv Sena, came to the government’s rescue and suggested that a decision be deferred at this stage. The suggestion drew loud protests from the Opposition. The Congress and Left Front members trooped into the well of the House to demand a division. Realising that the Opposition was in no mood to yield, the Speaker abruptly adjourned the House. On resumption of the session, the Opposition members again raised their demand for a division and prevented Mr K.Yerranaidu of the Telugu Desam, who was in the Chair, from taking up the next item on the agenda. Mr Naidu sought to cool tempers by stating that the Speaker was discussing the matter with the leaders of the political parties and the House should be allowed to proceed with routine business. An adamant Congress refused to heed and demanded a ""division first"". The House was then adjourned for the second time till 1415 hours. Mr Raghuvansh Prasad Singh (RJD) said the ordinance to replace the Essential Commodities Act had already lapsed and as of now there was no law to check hoarding and black marketing in essential commodities. The extension of time sought by the government would only help the hoarders to continue to loot the people. Mr Shiv Shankar (Cong) said certain provisions of the Essential Commodities Act were sought to be amended during the last session. When the Opposition then pointed that certain provisions were in fact diluting the original Act, the government decided to set up a joint committee. The Opposition was opposed to the constitution of the committee since it felt that it would delay matters. But now the government was seeking extension of time for the committee, he said. The government was also grilled by the combined Opposition in the Lok Sabha yesterday during the five-hour inconclusive debate on price rise. When there was no let up in the Opposition demand when the House met again after two adournments, Mr Yerranaidu said he was adjour resolved.","In the Lok Sabha, the Vajpayee government narrowly avoided a trial of strength following an unexpected move by the Opposition. The Opposition, comprising both Congress and non-Congress parties, appeared to outnumber the ruling coalition and demanded a vote on BJP member Shyam Bihari Mishra’s motion to extend the presentation deadline for a joint committee report on the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 1998. The House witnessed disruptions and had to adjourn twice. Resolution came after Speaker Mr. G.M.C. Balayogi held discussions with party leaders. The Union Food Minister, Mr. Surjit Singh Barnala, announced that a new comprehensive Bill on essential commodities would be introduced, which led to the Opposition dropping their voting demand. The Bill aims to strengthen measures against hoarders and blackmarketeers. The original amendment, introduced in a previous session, had faced Opposition resistance and was sent to the joint committee for review. The Opposition's stance was against further extension of the committee's timeframe, believing it would benefit hoarders. The government also faced criticism over rising prices in a previous Lok Sabha session.",Politics,1998-12-05 00:00:00

The disagreement highlighted divisions within the JD(U), with Bihar BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand dismissing concerns over NRC as propaganda.

"Arvind Kejriwal, Hemant Soren refuse ED summons: What happens now","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has cited Rajya Sabha elections, Republic Day celebrations and the Enforcement Directorate’s ‘non-disclosure’ and ‘non-response’ approach as reasons for not appearing for questioning before the investigating agency against its summons for appearance on January 3, in theDelhi excise policy case. In his earlier responses to two such summonses, Kejriwal alleged in his letter that the summons were issued at the behest of theBJPand said it was unclear in which capacity he was being summoned – “as a witness or a suspect”. Jharkhand CMHemant Sorenhas similarly refused seven summonses by ED in amoney laundering case. Here is all you need to know about ED summonses— and what happens when you refuse them. The provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) under which summons are issued nowhere mention that the investigating agency must declare that the person being summoned is an accused or not. In fact, the provisions are not clear whether the summons are to mention the grounds for questioning of a person. In practice, however, ED always mentions the case in which a person is being summoned to give evidence. “How can we declare a person as witness or accused even before questioning him or conducting proper investigations,” an ED official toldThe Indian Express. Summons for interrogation are issued by ED under Section 50 of the PMLA. According to the provision the Director of the ED, for the purposes of investigations, has the power of civil court for inspection, enforcing attendance of a person, compelling the production of record, receiving evidence on affidavits etc. According to the provision, “The Director, Additional Director, Joint Director, Deputy Director or Assistant Director shall have power to summon any person whose attendance he considers necessary whether to give evidence or to produce any records during the course of any investigation or proceeding under this Act”, and “all the persons so summoned shall be bound to attend in person or through authorised agents” as the ED officer may direct them to do. What if the person refuses to appear? The law has provision for penalty of up to Rs 10,000 and invocation of Section 174 of the Indian Penal Code that stipulates a jail term of one month and/or a fine of Rs 500 in case of non appearance against ED summons. Under Section 63 (2) (C) of the PMLA, if a person refuses to respect the summons issued by ED or refuses to produce documents or evidence as demanded by the agency, “shall pay, by way of penalty, a sum which shall not be less than five hundred rupees but which may extend to ten thousand rupees for each such default or failure”. Section 63 (4) says: “Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (c) of sub-section (2), a person who intentionally disobeys any direction issued under section 50 shall also be liable to be proceeded against under section 174 of the Indian Penal Code.” It is easier said than done. To arrest a person under Section 63 of the PMLA, the ED would have to get fresh case registered under Section 174 of the IPC and followed by a trial. Never has this route been followed in the history of the agency. The other legal route is to get non-bailable warrants issued against the person refusing summons. However, sources said, this would not be easy since most of those refusing summons, including Kejriwal and Soren, give written reasons for non-attendance. ED would have to convince the court that the non-cooperation is deliberate and there is prima facie evidence of the person being involved. Also court judgements have held that Section 50 does not allow ED to arrest a person summoned by it. There are no extant provisions in the PMLA to arrest for non-cooperation. There is also no limit to how many summons the agency must issue before reaching the conclusion that the person summoned is not cooperating. The law is clear that an arrest can be effected only if the officer is convinced that the person is guilty of the offence of money laundering. Section 19 of the PMLA says, “If the Director, Deputy Director, Assistant Director or any other officer authorised in this behalf by the Central Government by general or special order, has on the basis of material in his possession, reason to believe (the reason for such belief to be recorded in writing) that any person has been guilty of an offence punishable under this Act, he may arrest such person and shall, as soon as may be, inform him of the grounds for such arrest.” How have courts interpreted these provisons? The Delhi High Court on October 19, 2023 said the ED’s power to issue summons under Section 50 of the PMLA does not include the power to arrest a person and said the two are different and distinct. A single judge bench of Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani also said the power to arrest under Section 19 of the PMLA is not untrammelled and that “authorities do not have the power to arrest on their whims and fancies”. However, the bench said, Section 19 of the PMLA grants power of arrest to designated ED officers, “It is clear that the power to arrest does not reside in Section 50 nor does it arise as a natural corollary of summons issued under Section 50″. “The exercise of the powers under one, cannot be restrained on the apprehension that it could lead to the exercise of powers under the other. If that is permitted, any and every person summonsed under Section 50 of the PMLA… could resist such summons expressing mere apprehension that he may face arrest at the hands of the ED, in the exercise of the powers under section 19 of the PMLA,” the HC added. The HC also said a person apprehending arrest by the ED can file for anticipatory bail even if they are not named as an accused in the agency’s Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) or the prosecution complaint. “The power under section 50 of the PMLA to issue summons to a person and to require the production of documents and record statements, which is akin to the powers of a civil court, is different and distinct from the power under section 19 to arrest a person. These are two separate and distinct provisions,” said the HC judge.","Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's refusal to face questioning by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) cites ongoing ED summonses, Rajya Sabha elections preparations for Republic Day celebrations, and concerns over 'non-disclosure' tactics as reasons. Previously, he had alleged BJP influence in summon issuance and uncertainty about being a witness or suspect. Similarly, Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren has refused ED summonses related to money laundering cases multiple times without clear guidelines on when arrest can be initiated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The Delhi High Court ruled in October 2023 that Section 50's summon power is separate from and distinct from arrest powers, maintaining ED cannot arrest solely based on summons resistance.",Science and Technology,2024-01-04 00:00:00
Maharashtra ex-IGP says IB got Karkare killed,"NAGPUR: Former Inspector general of police SM Mushrif, who demanded a reinvestigation into the 26/11 incident through his controversial book ‘Who killed Karkare? The Real Face of Terrorism in India’ published in October last year, alleged that the Ram Pradhan committee report was a distorted and incomplete version of the facts. Mushrif, present in city on Sunday to address a meeting at Dhanwate National College, told TOI that he had highlighted in his book how former ATS chief Hemant Karkare was killed in a conspiracy hatched by Intelligence Bureau (IB) to pave way for the appointment of their favoured KP Raghuvanshi as ATS chief to thwart investigations against the Hindu hardliners allegedly involved in Malegaon blast of 2006. Mushrif had taken voluntary retirement from the force. “My book clearly exposed how IB conducted a parallel operation to eliminate Karkare in the lane of Rangbhavan. The modus operandi of the gun-wielding terrorists at the Taj-Oberoi-Trident was completely different from the one at Cama and Rangbhavan lanes. I have found out at least 11 stark contrasting elements in two operations. When there was firing at CST, gun-shots were also heard at Cama and Rangbhavan lanes. How can same people be at two different places at same time,” he asked “Moreover, there were also media reports corroborated by top government official about how the terrorists were speaking in Marathi at Cama. It is baffling how the Pakistan-based terrorists could speak in Marathi,” said Mushrif. He alleged that Raghuvanshi was brought in to shield the ‘big names’ that were surfacing in connection with Hindu terrorism. Mushrif claimed that Karkare’s death was an outcome of Brahminist forces colluding with IB. “There is no way the Pradhan committee could do any justice to the job it was assigned. I believe neither RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) nor IB co-operated with it. They also may not have got access to the voice records of the calls made through control room. The log book record is of no use as there is no authenticity in call timings recorded by a constable,” said Mushrif charging that IB conducted its own clandestine operation when the LeT gunmen were running amok elsewhere in Mumbai. “Even the Pradhan committee report leakage was part of the IB ploy to ascertain whether anyone knew the truth before it was actually tabled,” said Mushrif.","Former Inspector General of Police SM Mushrif, known for his controversial book 'Who killed Karkare?

Danish rider Jonas Vingegaard wins Tour de France for 2nd straight year,"Danish rider Jonas Vingegaard has won the Tour de France for a second straight year as cycling’s most storied race finished Sunday on the famed Champs-Élysées. With a huge lead built up over main rival Tadej Pogačar, the 2020 and 2021 winner, Vingegaard knew the victory was effectively his again before the largely ceremonial stage at the end of the 110th edition of the Tour. Vingegaard drank champagne with his Jumbo-Visma teammates as they lined up together and posed for photos on the way to Paris. It had been a three-week slog over 3,405 kilometers (2,116 miles) with eight mountain stages across five mountain ranges. Vingegaard seized control of the race over two stages in the Alps. Little had separated the two rivals until Vingegaard finished a time trial 1 minute, 38 seconds ahead of Pogačar on Tuesday, then followed up the next day by finishing the toughest mountain stage of the race almost 6 minutes ahead of his exhausted rival. “I’m dead,” Pogačar said. The Slovenian rider responded by winning the penultimate stage on Saturday, but Vingegaard still had an insurmountable lead of 7 minutes, 29 seconds going into the final stage – a mostly ceremonial stage which is contested at the end by the sprinters. “We have to be careful not to do anything stupid,” Vingegaard warned Saturday, “but yeah, it’s amazing to take my second victory in the Tour de France.” Belgian cyclist Jordi Meeus won the final stage in a photo finish between four riders on the line, just ahead of Jasper Philipsen, Dylan Groenewegen and Mads Pedersen. “It was my first Tour.

Indian space mavericks in Dubai’s celestial potential: Enhancing India-UAE space cooperation,"With recent historic space missions and announcement of the Emirates Mission to the Asteroid belt, opportunities for cutting edge space-tech start-ups are abounding in the UAE. Stellar ascent of Dubai beyond earth A string of successful launches and ambitious long-term goals have put the spotlight on UAE’s space program. Dubai played a significant role in this development with the establishment of the Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology (EIAST, 2006) later incorporated into the now famous Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC), formed in 2015. MBRSC oversaw the first Emirati-designed and manufactured satellite ‘KhalifaSat’ (launched in 2018) and managed the UAE Astronaut Program, which sent the first Arab astronauts to the International Space Station. UAE’s ambition is exemplified by the 3 billion AED National Space Fund managed by the UAE Space Agency to boost local and international space-tech companies. Space investments have now exceeded 22 billion AED, with commercial spending reaching 10.9 billion AED in 2020. Spacecrafts and statecraft UAE and India soared to space success this year, with record-setting missions of the longest-ever Arab space voyage and Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya-L1 operations respectively. Space technology is a key area of cooperation between India and UAE amidst flourishing bilateral relations. The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) was used to send the MBRSC’s Nayif-1 in 2017. Amidst the tech war between the US and China that is resulting in global siloing and technology barriers, India and UAE realised two vital things – the need to localise critical space and defence manufacturing and collaboration on technologies, expertise and funding. This lays the groundwork for a future India-UAE space corridor employing the strengths of each country - the design and manufacture of components in India; assembling, integration (high-end manufacturing) and testing in the UAE; and the final launch from India. Start-ups will play a vital role in this ecosystem. India’s ISRO established the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) in 2020, opening opportunities for private players in space exploration, manned missions, research, and international collaborations. Indian space start-ups have shown tremendous interest in participating in the Dubai Airshow 2023, which focuses on space exploration, with IN-SPACe facilitating these engagements. Orbiting opportunities Image 2 While explaining the opportunities in Dubai’s space sector, Prateep Basu, the Founder and CEO of SatSure Ltd said, “The MBRSC has been at the center of space exploration of the UAE. The space sector is a broad value chain that starts from satellite manufacturing and rocket launching. However, Dubai has also prioritized the downstream value chain, which revolves around data and value analytics. It is an evolving landscape and people like me are scouting for opportunities and partnerships.” Such partnerships can especially occur in manufacturing small components and satellite parts, knowledge transfer, and material supply. According to Sanjay Nekkanti, the Founder and CEO of Dhruva Space, “India has one of the most reliable launch vehicles which the UAE can benefit from when launching their satellites. Additionally, there are critical technologies where both countries can collaborate on, which could perhaps be built by the UAE with its local industries”. Being a part of the MBRSC Space Ventures program has exposed Dhruva Space to the global space community, networks and funding. Nekkanti said that “the initiative by the MBRSC to bring global innovative space companies into their ecosystem is commendable. We are eager to see how technologies developed in India can support the UAE’s space ambitions.” According to Dr. Devendran Thirunavukarasu, the Founder and CTO of ST Advanced Composites, “Dubai is the right place to establish regional offices to connect with the rest of the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.” ST Advanced Composites played an essential role in MBRSC’s Rashid-1 Lunar Rover in 2022 by supplying lightweight materials such as carbon fibre to reduce the weight of the payload. Dr. Devendran is in talks with the MBRSC to perform the same tasks for the Rashid-2 Rover. Regarding his collaboration with MBRSC, he highlighted the advantages of pre-existing smooth business relations and the lack of a language barrier. He said, “MBRSC was very supportive and decided a timeline with scheduled payments and planned weekly meetings to discuss updates and urgencies. They were also helpful in logistics and transport requirements from Chennai to Dubai.” Dubai is also seeking to employ other technologies in its space endeavours. The main theme of the Dubai Air Show 2023, slated for Nov 2023, is space exploration and strengthening of a new space economy led by private business, industries and start-ups. According to Ibrahim Al Qasim, Deputy Director-General of the UAE Space Agency “UAE is looking to facilitate enormous opportunities for start-ups in the UAE and there is no better platform than Dubai Air Show that has generated upward of AED 3 trillion in business.” The Air show also aims to facilitate discussions on wider use of space, including correlation between aerospace and climate change. Navigating the space-time continuum Navigating the opportunities in Dubai’s space spectrum will require Indian startups to understand the local challenges and culture. Besides additional costs, they would have to compete with established players in the industry with advanced capabilities and adapt to stringent regulations while collaborating with international and government agencies. Moreover, as the UAE is keen on localising the entire supply chain, Indian start-ups may find it harder to manufacture within the UAE as it remains more cost-effective to ‘make in India’ and then export. When expanding to newer geographies, Indian start-ups analyze various factors such as market opportunities and incentives. According to Basu “one thing that attracts entrepreneurs is certainty around policy and regulations. The second is the government's support in enabling partnerships with local industries and foreign companies. Dubai is already well-integrated with the global industry with its financial services, and we examine how the government enables space sector companies to leverage its international relations.” Beyond the stars With historic achievements this year and the recent announcement of the Emirates Mission to the Asteroid belt (EMA), opportunities abound in Dubai for nanosatellites, moon missions and interplanetary explorations. Indian start-ups agree on the potential for collaboration with Dubai and call for more joint ventures and bilateral agreements between the two countries in this sector. According to Dr. Devendran, “Bilateral research programs with the funding and collaborations of the Science and Technology departments from both governments will provide mutual benefits. Dubai can benefit from the experience of India in space projects and cost-effective solutions provided by start-ups and MSMEs.” Click this link for more on Business in Dubai.

There was no independent verification to this so far.Naik had his passport renewed in January last year and it has a validity for 10 years.The NIA, on November 18, 2016, had registered a criminal case against Naik at its Mumbai branch under various sections of Indian Penal Code and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.His organisation, Islamic Research Foundation (IRF), has already been declared as an unlawful association by the government a day prior to registering of the case.The controversial preacher is accused of spreading hatred by his provocative speeches, funding terrorists and laundering several crores of rupees over the years.The sources could not give the exact country where Naik could be at present and said that he may be changing his base quite frequently after the NIA moved the Interpol for issuance of a Red Corner Notice (RCN), international arrest warrant, against him.The Interpol was approached against Naik after a year- long probe during which the NIA gathered evidence of his IRF and Peace TV being used to allegedly promote hatred between different religious groups.The central government has already banned his NGO and taken his TV channel off air. During the probe, the NIA claimed to have found 37 properties owned by Naik and companies run by him, which are estimated to be worth more than Rs 100 crore.A special NIA court in Mumbai, while issuing a non- bailable warrant against Naik, had said that ?there are reasonable grounds to believe that Naik is evading arrest and that he will not voluntarily appear before the court or before the agency.?The NIA alleged that Naik has been promoting enmity and hatred between different religious groups in India through his speeches and lectures on various platforms and inciting Muslim youths and terrorists in India and abroad to commit terrorist acts.",Islamic preacher Zakir Naik's passport was revoked on Tuesday by the Regional Passport Office of Mumbai. The travel document was revoked after he failed to respond to a show cause notice that directed him to appear in person by July 13.

"Back Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon to fight Google book deal","San Francisco: The fight against a legal settlement that would give Google Inc. the digital rights to millions of copyrighted books is starting to resemble a heavyweight brawl in the library. Microsoft Corp., Yahoo Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are joining a coalition that hopes to rally opposition to Google’s digital book ambitions and ultimately persuade a federal judge to block or revise the Internet search leader’s plans. The group, to be called the Open Book Alliance, is being put together by the Internet Archive, a longtime critic of Google’s crusade to make digital copies of as many printed books as possible. A growing number of critics already have filed objections to Google’s book settlement, but none have the clout that the Open Book Alliance figures to wield with three of the world’s best-known technology companies on board. Peter Brantley, the Internet Archive’s director of access, provided some of the details about the alliance’s members and objectives in a Thursday interview. Both Microsoft and Yahoo have confirmed their intention to join the alliance. Amazon declined to comment because the group hasn’t been formally announced yet. The Open Book Alliance also will include an assortment of nonprofit groups. Among other things, the alliance will try to persuade the US Justice Department that Google’s broad settlement with authors and publishers could undermine competition in the digital book market just as more consumers are gravitating toward electronic readers like Amazon.com’s Kindle. In a bit of irony, the alliance is working closely with Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer who helped convince the Justice Department to file an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft that tormented the software maker during the late 1990s. Reback didn’t respond to a message left late Thursday. The Justice Department already is assessing the possible fallout from Google’s book settlement, which is scheduled to be reviewed by US District Judge Denny Chin in an 7 October court hearing in New York. Microsoft, Yahoo and Amazon all have financial reasons for objecting to the class-action lawsuit settlement that Google reached with authors and publishers 10 months ago. Amazon may have the most at stake, given that it’s a major book seller and is mining the Kindle for even more sales. Google plans to offer free access to some books through its search engine and sell others as part of a registry that will share revenue with authors and publishers if the class-action settlement is approved. Opponents of the deal believe it will give Google too much pricing power, and have raised concerns about the company’s ability to stockpile more personal data about the users of its search engines by tracking what they’re reading. “We see many disadvantages in this settlement,"" the Internet Archive’s Brantley said. Others see tremendous benefits. A wide cross-section of libraries, colleges and authors have endorsed Google’s book settlement. Mountain View-based Google argues that the settlement will be a boon for consumers, who will have easier access to potentially valuable information now gathering dust in remote library shelves. And, Google says, authors and publishers will be able to make more money from out-of-print books. “The Google Books settlement is injecting more competition into the digital books space, so it’s understandable why our competitors might fight hard to prevent more competition,"" Google spokesman Gabriel Stricker said. “That said, it’s ironic that some of these complaints are coming from a company that abandoned its book digitization effort because it lacked ’commercial intent’."" Stricker was taking a stab at Microsoft, which abandoned its efforts to make digital book copies to focus on more profitable online opportunities. Microsoft and Yahoo could be hurt if Google’s expanded index of digital books propels even more traffic to its search engine. If that were to happen, Google might process even more search requests than it already does, allowing the company to show more of the text ads alongside search results that generate most of its revenue. Hoping to siphon advertising away from Google, Microsoft and Yahoo last month announced a planned partnership in search. The proposal, which still must be approved by the Justice Department, calls for Microsoft to run the search engine on Yahoo’s web site in return for 12% of the revenue generated by accompanying ad sales.","A coalition called the Open Book Alliance, led by the Internet Archive, is uniting tech giants Microsoft, Yahoo, and Amazon to oppose Google's digital book settlement. Concerns over Google's potential monopolization of the digital book market and data privacy issues drive the opposition. Led by Silicon Valley lawyer Gary Reback, who once challenged Microsoft's antitrust practices, the alliance aims to sway the Justice Department's opinion ahead of a crucial court hearing. While Google touts benefits for consumers and authors, rivals fear its dominance and seek to curb its influence.",Technology and Gadgets,2009-08-21 00:00:00
"Huawei breaks price ceiling with $2,600 folding 5G smartphone","Huawei Technologies unveiled a folding smartphone on Sunday which it said was primed for next generation 5G mobile connections, even as the United States campaigns to bar the Chinese company from such networks over security concerns. Huawei, the worlds third-largest smartphone vendor after Samsung and Apple, said it had taken the lead on developing phones for 5G — which promise super fast internet speeds for consumers and businesses — because it was also involved in developing the networks. “This phone is not only for today for 5G but also for future 5G. On all the benchmarks you can see the performance, the speed is the fastest for 5G in the world,” said Richard Yu, head of Huawei's consumer business group. Speaking ahead of the mobile industry's biggest global event, which kicks of on Monday in Barcelona, Yu said the Huawei Mate X will have two back-to-back screens which unfold to become an eight-inch tablet display. Yu said the Mate X would be able to download a 1 gigabyte movie in three seconds but also be priced at 2,299 euros ($2,607) when it goes on sale later this year, setting a new upper limit for consumer smartphones. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd last week unveiled its own folding smartphone, priced at nearly $2,000, in a bid to top the technology of Apple Inc and Chinese rivals and reignite consumer interest amid slumping sales. Huawei, which is also the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, is under intense scrutiny in the West over U.S.-led allegations of enabling Chinese state espionage, accusations which the company denies. Huawei's chairman said on Sunday recent comments by U.S. President Donald Trump that the U.S. needed to get ahead in mobile communications through competition rather than seeking to block technology was “clear and correct”.","Huawei unveiled its Mate X folding smartphone on Sunday, designed for next-gen 5G connectivity.

Political parties polarising communities for electoral gains,"With the 2024 general election just months away, suddenly communal tension is rising in many parts of the country. Be it Uttarakhand, Manipur, or Maharashtra, communal tension targetting the minorities is rising. The situation is alarming in particular in the abovementioned three states. Uttarakhand burns with rising violence against Muslim residents as allegations of ‘love jihad’ against the community are being made by the majority Hindu. Posters were put up in front of Muslim shop owners’ doors in parts of Uttarakhand, warning them to leave their establishments by 15 June, ahead of a scheduled Mahapanchyat called by Hindu organisations. There is growing fear among the Muslims. In Maharashtra too communal tension is flaring up. At the heart of it are various social media posts related to Aurangzeb and Tipu Sultan, which sparked communal tension. Following the communal tension, Section 144 has been imposed in the city of Kolhapur, which is the worst affected. In Manipur, it is alleged that the Hindu majority Meitei community has inflicted major violence against the minority Kuki tribe, who are predominantly Christians. This rising communal tension ahead of the general election signals that the situation will get worse as the election nears. There are some political parties who only know how to win elections by polarising the voters, which is really unfortunate. They are hurting the interests of the nation for their political benefits.","As the 2024 general election approaches, communal tensions are intensifying in Uttarakhand, Manipur, and Maharashtra.

"Shiv Sena, Congress ‘match-fixed’ 42 seats: BJP","MUMBAI: The race to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is heating up with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claiming on Sunday that there has been “match-fixing” in 42 wards between the Congress and the Shiv Sena in 42 wards. Civic polls in the city will be held on February 21. “Both parties have only one agenda and that is to defeat the BJP. Both parties have given tickets to candidates in a manner that satisfies each party’s needs. They have fielded weak candidates in these wards to benefit each other,” BJP city unit president Ashish Shelar alleged, and claimed to have a list of 42 such wards where the Sena and Congress have jointly picked candidates. “This is against the principles of Shivaji Maharaj, anti-Mumbai and anti-Maharashtra. We are not scared of such tactics. We will not only win seats where we have strength but also where this match-fixing has taken place,” he said. BJP State president Raosaheb Danve claimed his party tried till the eleventh hour to ensure an alliance with the Sena. “We have always wanted it, but it was the Sena which decided to snap ties. We are going to win Mumbai to ensure transparent and clean administration in the city,” he said. Mr. Shelar claimed Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray decided against the alliance because of his party’s decision to take action against corrupt BMC contractors. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi began a war against black money, and our party arrested corrupt civic contractors and chargesheeted civic officials. This is the reason why this party (Sena) left us.” To counter allegations by the Opposition that the BJP is trying to carve Mumbai out of Maharashtra, the party on Sunday launched its campaign with an oath-taking ceremony by its candidates at Hutatma Chowk, a monument erected to honour 105 martyrs who fought for a united Maharashtra. In his first election rally in South Mumbai on Saturday, Mr. Thackeray had said his party will not allow the State to be “cut in to pieces”.

India car sales grow fastest since 2010-11,"Car sales rose 7.87% from the previous year to 2.025 million units in the year ended 31 March, highest since the 29% increase y-o-y in 2010-11 New Delhi: Sales of passenger cars in India grew at the fastest pace in five years in the 12 months to 31 March, but the automobile industry lobby group on Friday slashed its forecast for the current fiscal year, saying measures to fight vehicular pollution would hurt demand. Car sales rose 7.87% from the previous year to 2.025 million units in the year ended 31 March, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said. That’s the fastest pace of growth since 2010-11, at the height of an economic boom, when sales had expanded 29% year-on-year. Yet, SIAM cut its forecast for car sales growth in 2016-17 to 6-8% from an earlier 11%, citing higher taxes and a ban on the sale of large diesel cars in the National Capital Region (NCR) centred around New Delhi, which the World Health Organization in 2014 rated as the world’s most polluted city.“Maybe the industry is not confident of growing at 11%,” said Sugato Sen, deputy director general of SIAM. “There is not just one reason for that. Many things have changed in the last one year. I don’t remember anything that this government has done in the last one year to support this industry. In fact, they have done everything to curb this industry’s growth.” On 31 March, the Supreme Court extended a ban on sales of high-end diesel vehicles in Delhi-NCR, indicating that it could be lifted with the imposition of an environmental cess on their purchase. On 16 December 2015, the court barred the registration of diesel vehicles with engines bigger than 2000cc in Delhi-NCR till 31 March. It also doubled the entry tax on trucks coming into Delhi and took 10-year-old diesel commercial vehicles off the capital’s roads.In the preceding fiscal year, car sales had grown 5.09% to 1.87 million units after shrinking for two consecutive fiscal years in 2012-13 and 2013-14 in the face of an economic downturn. In the fiscal year just gone by, sales of all passenger vehicles including cars, vans and utility vehicles grew 7.24% to a record 2.79 million units, according to SIAM data. Sales of two-wheelers rose 3.01% to 16.46 million units. And, in a sign of an improved economic environment, sales of all other vehicle categories such as commercial vehicles and three-wheelers also posted growth during the year, taking the combined sales of all categories of vehicles to a record 20.46 million units. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has said that it wants to turn the automotive sector into the “mother of manufacturing activities” by making it the engine of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative.","In the fiscal year ending March 31, car sales in India surged by 7.87%, reaching 2.025 million units, marking the fastest growth rate in five years since 2010-11's 29% rise.

IMD targets impact-based weather forecast,"NEW DELHI: Besides providing weather forecast, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has on an experimental basis started a system to predict the likely impact of the rainfall in the country. The forecast impact will be based on the inputs received from agencies like ministry of earth sciences, ISRO, Surveyor of India, municipal bodies and public works department. The impact of rainfall forecast will include details on flooding of roads, closure of underpasses, water logging in low lying areas, occasional reduction in visibility, soil erosion, disruption of traffic flow in cities, localised mud-sliding and damage to vulnerable structures. At present, the IMD provides only weather updates with colour coding. IMD director general Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said that the target has been set to provide impact-based weather forecast across the country. As a pilot project, he said that the IMD on Friday started providing rainfall impact forecast on a host of services in four cities — Bhubaneswar, Guwahati, Ahmedabad and Srinagar. Dr Mohapatra said that the information related to rainfall will also include latest update on condition of roads, traffic jams, localised flooding of roads and drains, soil erosion, possibilities of damage to vulnerable structures, water logging, closure of underpasses, damage to kutcha roads and horticulture crops. He said that the IMD will work with the state departments, disaster management authority and national space agency and collate geographical information system and geospatial information system, along with other socio-economic data, including population and distribution of houses. The primary aim of the exercise is to provide weather information on a digital platform, with geographical co-ordinates giving locations for residential areas, hospitals and schools. “Instead of just giving weather information, we want to provide impact-based weather information and risk based warnings, not only for meteorological hazards, but geo-physical hazards,” he said. Dr Mohapatra said that the accuracy in climate monitoring and forecasting has gone up over the years. He said the main challenge was “not only to tell about weather conditions, but also about it direct implications.”","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has initiated an experimental system to predict the likely impact of rainfall in the country, in addition to providing weather forecasts.

Over the years, his trouble-shooting days in the Congress under Okram Ibobi had somehow remained stuck in his personality, as can be seen from his head-on or hands-on approach on every issue, his accessibility and his direct engagement with various stakeholders, be it in politics or officialdom or with civil society organisations. He has finally managed to emerge from that cocoon and now he is brimming with confidence, as can be seen from his recent moves. Right from Day One, it was not an easy ride for the beleaguered Chief Minister. From managing the coalition partners to balancing the ever increasing demands of newly acquired friends from Congress and party MLAs who were left out of the ministry, not to talk of dissidence within the party ranks and of learning a new culture as inspired by the Sangh Parivar, it was indeed a perilous journey fraught with danger and unseen forces. Somehow, he seems to have weathered the storm, as he gets full backing from the all-powerful Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP leadership in the Centre. Nowadays, he is seen having a cosy relationship with the new state party president and MPs, which was absent earlier. Now, this Monday is very important, not only of voting on the trust motion but also about his grip on the coalition government and the party. The Manipur Legislative Assembly has now an effective strength of 53 legislators, with 4 disqualified and 3 BJP legislators whose resignations were accepted by the Speaker. Of these 53 legislators, BJP and its partners numbered 28 excluding the Speaker while that of Indian National Congress is 24 including the silent supporters of the BJP led government. Numbers are very much in favour of the N Biren Singh government. Even without the votes of the Congress friendlies, the government is safe to the naked eye. But who knows? Political fortunes are made and unmade every day and Chief Minister N Biren Singh is not taking any chances. We all have seen the twists and turns of the recently held Rajya Sabha elections. Lucky that party whips cannot be issued in the case of Rajya Sabha elections. That is how Biren Singh managed to get the BJP candidate Leishemba Sanajaoba elected through cross-voting. Even the party high command had given up hope on Manipur electing a BJP nominee for the lone RS seat, following withdrawal of support by its partner NPP and other two MLAs one Trinamool and the other Independent. The feat was considered spectacular by the BJP higher-ups, including Amit Shah and General Secretary Organisation B L Santosh, it seems. Now, it is but certain that Biren Singh might have a few aces up his sleeves both for the trust motion and his political future. It appears, he has set his eye on a second term as Chief Minister. Perhaps he might even trigger a split in the Congress ranks. Who knows?","Chief Minister N Biren Singh, confident after Speaker Yumnam Khemchand rejected a no-confidence motion from Okram Ibobi-led Congress, has filed a motion of trust in his government for discussion and voting on Monday in the Manipur Legislative Assembly. Biren Singh, who has transformed from a Congress trouble-shooter under Okram Ibobi to a confident political leader, faces the challenge of balancing coalition partners, managing demands from party members, and navigating the culture inspired by the Sangh Parivar. His leadership has gained backing from Union Home Minister Amit Shah and the BJP leadership at the Centre. Monday's trust motion is crucial for assessing his control over the coalition government and the party. With the Manipur Legislative Assembly currently having 53 legislators, BJP and its partners number 28, while Congress has 24 members. The numbers favor Biren Singh's government, though he remains cautious. Biren Singh’s recent success in getting BJP candidate Leishemba Sanajaoba elected to the Rajya Sabha through cross-voting has impressed BJP higher-ups, enhancing his political standing. Biren Singh seems poised for a second term as Chief Minister and may have strategic moves in place for both the trust motion and his political future, potentially even causing a split in the Congress ranks.",Opinion and Editorial,2020-09-10 00:00:00

Exports down 4 per cent in May,"Amid weak economic sentiment and falling industrial output, India, on Thursday, reported a 4.16 per cent drop in its exports at $25.68 billion in May, mainly due to slump in global demand and slowdown in domestic industrial growth. Imports also fell by 7.36 per cent to $41.9 billion. The trade deficit also narrowed to $16.3 billion during the month, from $18.5 billion a year ago. “We have also seen the IIP (index of industrial production) numbers. So, you can correlate the reasons why exports have not done too well…we are recalibrating strategy to meet an ambitious 20 per cent growth target in exports for the current fiscal,” Commerce Secretary S. R. Rao told journalists here. He pointed out that contraction of demand in India's traditional markets, particularly in eurozone economies, was hurting exports.","Amid weak economic sentiment and falling industrial output, India, on Thursday, reported a 4.16 per cent drop in its exports at $25.68 billion in May, mainly due to slump in global demand and slowdown in domestic industrial growth.

"Bengaluru’s art, music and showbiz frat discuss the challenges of content creation during lockdown","Addressing the challenges and prospects of content creation during the lockdown, was our panel of artistes comprising filmmakers and actors Pawan Kumar, Pannaga Bharana, artiste Baadal Nanjundaswamy and musician Vasu Dixit. Excerpts from the discussion.... Pawan, you've organised podcasts, live chats with startups and even a marathon fundraising session during the lockdown. What keeps you innovating? What motivated me was a newspaper article about the lockdown that read - Indians want the government to do everything, they don't want to do anything themselves. This made me sit up to do things and see how far can it go. It was all organic. I'd just do what I felt like doing, without any planning. It keeps me occupied, as well as connects me to newer audiences. Pannaga, you've put together a celebrity video and even done one of the first Instagram live theatrical performances. What were the challenges?When the lockdown started, the first two weeks were all about relaxing. Then we woke up and realised that we should do something creative. We decided to do a song where wanted to show people that together even this shall pass. The major challenge was to get people to send us videos and content, as everyone was used to relaxing. Work that usually takes two hours, took two days under the current situations. Vasu, you made a lot of music, including a home series called Gyan Mandali...For most artistes, necessity is the mother of invention. Artistes love constraints and challenges. Personally, I really wanted a time like this. It might sound selfish and greedy, but I really wanted to work on my stuff that I had procrastinated on. Even Gyan Mandali was a spontaneous thing. My wife and I would do such things when we would go to friends' houses. Since we were together for such a long time and not travelling - we decided that we should do something besides music. Since this was a common ground that we both enjoyed, we just wanted to have fun. And Baadal, you use the city as your canvas... I first panicked when news of the pandemic broke out. It took a while for me to compose myself. When I wanted to do something there weren't any materials. I found a few sketch pens and pencils and charcoal. I tried to create something using those. It was hard, as I have enjoyed using walls or roads as I wanted the art to reach the common people too. So I used three walls in my house as the canvas. Many days later, I created some awareness artwork on the streets near my house. Commissioner of police Bhaskar Rao dropped by to see it. What has the lockdown taught all of you? Vasu: This lockdown has been all about going deeper within myself - with or without my art. For my art, it is about what I can improve. Pawan: I have looked at it as a process of reboot. It is about starting something fresh instead of going back to old practices. These days have taught me what I need and don't need. In terms of work, it has helped me connect to people through newer mediums, in a simple way. Pannaga: We have a false idea of our needs. These days have taught me what is actually required. As a creative person, it has taught me self-motivation. It has also taught the importance of human connection - to work together and help one another. Baadal: As artistes, it has helped us connect and find inspiration with things that are closer home - quite literally. It has made us more mindful of our surroundings. This is a time for sharing and change.","During the lockdown, artists have faced unique challenges in content creation. Pawan Kumar has utilized the time to innovate with podcasts, live chats, and fundraisers. Pannaga Bharana highlights the challenges of engaging audiences remotely. Vasu Dixit turned to home-based projects such as ""Gyan Mandali."" Baadal Nanjundaswamy found inspiration in his surroundings, using his home as a canvas. Despite the challenges, all the artists emphasized the importance of resilience, self-motivation, and connecting with their audiences in new ways. The lockdown has prompted a reevaluation of their needs and priorities, leading to a focus on simplicity, collaboration, and a deeper connection with their art.",Entertainment,2020-05-15 00:00:00
"CM holds management, officials responsible for losses in Apex Bank","ITANAGAR, Jul 25: Chief Minister Pema Khandu held the management and officials responsible for the ‘bad phase’ witnessed by the Arunachal Pradesh State Cooperative Apex Bank Ltd. Expressing concern over the accumulated losses of the bank over the years, the chief minister asked the officers and administrators of the bank to improve their work culture to regain the past glory. “If the bank is incurring huge loss due to bad loans, it is because of your lapses. You need to correct yourself for the bank to revive and sustain as a successful banking institution. I want to see a completely revamped work culture in the organization,” he said after launching the micro-ATM services of the bank at a simple function at his office here on Wednesday. “The bank was established with the sole aim of serving the rural and poor people of the state. It has to regain the confidence of people to make up for its lost glory.” Pema said that people will opt for the Apex Bank only if they have confidence in it. “You have to forget the past, particularly the lean period that the bank had to pass through, and give your best to revive the bank,” he asserted. Pema assured that the state government will help the bank in all possible means and will consider parking government funds with the bank. He also directed strict action against loan defaulters and asked the chief secretary to engage the deputy commissioners actively in recovery. Lauding the Apex Bank – the lone state owned bank – for extending its reach of services to the last man in the queue, Pema said inclusion of micro-ATM services will immensely benefit the rural and poor people availing banking services. The Apex Bank, which has 37 branches, will launch 200 Micro-ATM services across the state. Micro ATM is a mini version of an ATM with modified point of sales terminals. This terminal can connect to banking network via GPRS to perform banking transactions. This machine contains card swipe facility and fingerprint scanner and can be carried by bank representative at remote/mobile locations. It has facilities like cash withdrawal, cash deposit, Aadhar-enabled payments and accept payments through debit/credit cards. Minister Cooperation Honchun Ngandam also expressed concern over the recovery rate from loan defaulters. He urged the bank officials to coordinate with the district administrations and fast-track its recovery process, while asserting that money of the poor people cannot be taken for ransom by few defaulters. Ngandam also acknowledged the suggestion to park some government funds with the Apex Bank to keep it running successfully. As a symbolic launch of the services, micro-ATM machines were handed over to Aalo, Rupa, Naharlagun all-women bank, Ganga and Itanagar branches. The programme was also attended by Chief Secretary Satya Gopal, the Finance commissioner and secretary and officials of the State Cooperative Apex Bank Limited.","Pema Khandu held the management and officials responsible for the ‘bad phase’ witnessed by the Arunachal Pradesh State Cooperative Apex Bank Ltd.

Startups withdraw internships offers to B-school students amid second wave of Covid-19,"First-year MBA students across IIMs – from Lucknow to Shillong - and other B-schools have taken to professional networking site LinkedIn to air their displeasure after companies revoked internship offers citing economic uncertainty following the Covid-19 second wave. From cybersecurity to business-to-business sales and mid-sized startups, companies across sectors have informed Bschool placement cells that the internships are on hold or that they would not pay stipends, at least a dozen MBA students told ET. “They should’ve told us before. They kept on stalling,” a student at one of the IIMs said, asking specifically that the IIM be not named. Over 1,000 students from MBA and Engineering colleges like IIT-Bombay, various IIMs, Wellingkar Mumbai, Delhi University, Symbiosis Pune, and Banaras Hindu University have filled out a form between April 28-April 30 to obtain an internship through Mission Summer Internship an initiative by Mission Helping Hands. ""These are the students whose internships have gotten revoked due to the second phase of Covid,"" says Dr Shubhra Chakraborty, founder of Mission Helping Hands. The initiative placed 384 students for summer internships last year when the first wave of the pandemic hit. It received over 1,700 registration over a period of two weeks. ""Our number this year is going to be higher than last year. We launched just three days ago,"" says Chakraborty. ET could not independently verify how many such internship offers had been refused across the B-schools. The IIM student said the withdrawal was announced just three days before his joining date despite repeatedly checking with the internal placement cell leading up to the start date. “We lost a month, I would have gone to some other company and interned,” he said. For many students who have a hefty education loan to repay, an internship is key to step up from the first to the second year. The uncertainty is now causing them to take up any role on offer. “People are trying to exploit us for work we do as an intern,” said a 25-year-old who took to LinkedIn to find an internship after his offer was withdrawn. “It has become a joke at this point. They are hiring from IIM and they don’t want to pay. That hurts.” Another student whose internship offered was not honoured said: “We are looking for new opportunities through our own contacts but it’s difficult due to the ongoing pandemic.” A 23-year-old MBA student from Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, was informed by a Mumbai-based ed-tech startup a week after joining that he would no longer be paid due to “pandemic-related reasons.” “Business valuation can be done from home. I would have done it on my laptop even if I was working out of their Noida office. There is no difference,” the student, who has taken an education loan of Rs 17 lakh, said. A friend’s offer to intern at an NSE-listed manufacturing company was postponed indefinitely last week, he added. According to several students, Israel-based cybersecurity company Gamasec, which had plans to expand in India, withdrew scores of summer internship offers from IIMs and other B-schools. Explaining why, a former senior executive at the firm said the role had required them be physically present in its office in Bengaluru. E-commerce content startup Mason had to pull back summer internship offers in its marketing department as the team leads were infected with Covid-19. The company has, however, on-boarded interns in operations and sales, said Kausambi Manjita, founder and CEO of the Accel and Lightspeed Venture Partners-funded startup. “You have an obligation to people who join to make them successful. It is worse for someone to join you especially fresh out of college and have nobody to support you,” Manjita said, adding that placement cells at top-tier colleges were scrambling to help students. On Friday, she received one such request from the placement cell of a top-tier management institute to onboard a student for a six-week internship, for free. A spokesperson for IIM Bangalore declined to comment on how many summer internship offers had been withdrawn. IIM Indore did not respond to similar queries. Full-time offers out Some MBA grads are still reeling from the economic after-effects of the first wave. Shubham Ram, who completed his Post Graduate Diploma in Management from IIEBM-Indus Business School in Pune, was offered a job at HDFC Ergo last year with a joining date in June. The company repeatedly deferred that for eight months, said Ram, who had taken a Rs 10 lakh student loan to fund his MBA dream. In February this year, the company's HR person “left the WhatsApp group and revoked our offer,” he said. “They smashed our future. They should have informed us sooner or said we will come to you, but bharosa mat rakho (don't count on us),” Ram, who is currently working night shifts at a small Pune-based company, added. ""HDFC ERGO has not revoked any offer formally made to any of the candidates,"" a company spokesperson said. Hiring of fresh graduates for non-technology roles has also slowed slightly, according to Anshuman Das, CEO of CareerNet and Longhouse Consulting, which counts Flipkart, Goldman Sachs and Tata Consultancy Services among its clients.","First-year MBA students at IIMs and other B-schools are expressing dissatisfaction on LinkedIn after companies revoked internship offers due to economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 second wave.

PM ready to appear before PAC,"New Delhi, December 20 Taking the battle to the Opposition camp, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today offered to appear before the Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in connection with the 2G Spectrum scam probe, saying “he had nothing to hide”. And their leader’s unusual aggressive stance enthused the Congress workers, who otherwise appeared demoralized due to the Opposition’s impending nationwide campaign against “corruption” during the UPA regime. Speaking on the concluding day of the Congress plenary at Burari here, the Prime Minister said the BJP had been “falsely propagating” that the UPA government had declined to set up a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) as it did not want the Prime Minister to be questioned, implying that “I have something to hide”. “I wish to state categorically that I have nothing to hide from the public and as a proof of my Bonafide's, I shall be happy to appear before the PAC if it asks me to do so,” he said. Stating that like Caesar’s wife the Prime Minister should be above suspicion, he said he was prepared to appear before the PAC though there was no precedent to that effect. Notably, the Prime Minister’s announcement to appear before the PAC and his attack on the Opposition comes two days ahead of the BJP-led NDA’s rally in Delhi to “expose the UPA government’s involvement in various corruption scams”. The BJP, it is learnt, would explain to the public the reasons behind their pressing for a JPC probe, a demand for which the party disrupted the entire Winter session of Parliament. Congress leaders were quick to welcome the Prime Minister’s offer, stating that it was “extremely well-timed” as he had not only “seized the high moral ground” but would also dent the Opposition’s campaign against the UPA government. Describing it as a “masterstroke”, AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh told media persons later that it was nothing short of a “brave gesture”. “I congratulate the Prime Minister for making an unprecedented brave and extraordinary offer to appear before the PAC. It’s a masterstroke,” he said, adding that never before in the history of independent India had a prime minister appeared before a parliamentary committee. In keeping with the party’s strategy to go on the offensive, the Prime Minister’s speech at the plenary contained a strident attack against the BJP-led Opposition. He accused it of “obduracy” over its insistent demand for a JPC probe into the 2G Spectrum issue and said the government felt that a JPC would only delay the inquiry and politicize the matter as the government had already ordered a multi-agency probe into the matter. He said a PAC in itself was a joint parliamentary committee presided over by senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi and had all the necessary powers. Hitting out at the BJP, he said while the Congress had asked its ministers and chief ministers to step down on mere charges, opposition parties insisted on retaining their tainted chief ministers. Giving details about various agencies investigating the 2G Spectrum issue and the Commonwealth Games, Manmohan Singh sent out an unambiguous message that the guilty would be punished irrespective of the power they yielded and their party affiliation. “It is my promise to you that no guilty person will be spared,” he said.","On December 20, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered to appear before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to address the 2G Spectrum scam, claiming he had ""nothing to hide."" This statement came amid increasing opposition pressure and the BJP's planned nationwide anti-corruption campaign against the UPA government. The Prime Minister rejected accusations from the BJP that the government had avoided setting up a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to prevent his questioning. He declared his willingness to appear before the PAC, despite there being no precedent for a Prime Minister doing so. Singh also criticized the BJP for its insistence on a JPC, arguing that it would only politicize the investigation and delay the inquiry, which was already being handled by multiple agencies. Congress leaders welcomed the Prime Minister's bold stance, calling it a ""masterstroke"" and a ""brave gesture,"" as it sought to counter the Opposition's narrative of corruption. Singh also reiterated the government's commitment to ensuring that those guilty of wrongdoing would be held accountable.",Politics,2010-12-21 00:00:00
Criminalization of politics,"Growing criminalization of politics has been a most disturbing phenomenon… candidates with criminal backgrounds are not just contesting ... but are also getting elected… Among the 264 candidates in the first phase, 41 have criminal cases against them… 10 of the 43 Congress nominees, eight of the 41 AJP and three of the 39 BJP have declared criminal cases… charge‑sheeted and convicted politicians are known to have contested and won polls.

Neutralising a mass killer,"The curiosity and keen observation shown by a single doctor at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi in 1985, combined with unprecedented team work by people from 13 institutions, both in India and abroad, would soon start annually saving the lives of thousands of children aged less than five years from a mass killer — rotavirus diarrhoea. In India, the disease annually kills over 100,000 children below the age of one, making the country account for a quarter of all global deaths caused by rotavirus diarrhoea. The majority of instances of the disease caused by the virus occurs during the first two years of age. According to results published recently in The Lancet , a Phase III trial of an indigenously developed rotavirus vaccine 116E carried out in three centres was found to be safe; it had 56.4 per cent efficacy in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants during their first year of life. Though the efficacy of the vaccine is only modest, it is superior to currently available ones. In the case of high-burden countries like India, even the modest efficacy of the vaccine would go a long way in reducing the number of deaths. The efficacy would further shoot up when widespread immunity is achieved through sustained vaccination of a majority of infants. Hence, there is a real possibility of the number of deaths dropping sharply in a few years after the introduction of the vaccine. It can also bring about a major reduction in the number of instances of hospitalisation in those aged below five, within two years of its introduction. The vaccine, which would be made available to the government at not more than $1 a dose, is expected to be licensed shortly. It is imperative that the government quickly includes it in the national immunisation programme. The fact that three doses can be co-administered with other vaccines during the routine immunisation schedule makes it all the more attractive. While it is true that improving sanitation and hygiene levels is insufficient to rein in rotavirus diarrhoea, there is a compelling need to improve social infrastructure in order to control other pathogen-caused diseases like cholera. Besides the direct benefits from the vaccine, the isolation of the human neo-natal rotavirus strain and the conduct of clinical trials in India have given the science of vaccine development a much-needed boost. Though it has taken nearly 30 years to reach this stage, the development of this vaccine proves that Indian companies can take to completion clinical trials of novel drug candidates. In fact, the government should adopt the same model to develop drugs for other neglected tropical diseases that primarily affect people living in poverty in the developing countries.","In India, a Phase III trial of an indigenously developed rotavirus vaccine, called 116E, has shown to be safe with a 56.4% efficacy in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants during their first year of life. The vaccine, which is expected to be licensed shortly, could save thousands of children from rotavirus diarrhoea, which kills over 100,000 children below the age of one in India every year. The efficacy of the vaccine is considered modest but superior to currently available ones. It is expected that the number of deaths could drop sharply in a few years after the introduction of the vaccine.

Kerala complains to TN about toxic vegetables,"The Kerala government has informed Tamil Nadu that vegetables brought from that state were found to have pesticide residues three or four times more than the permissible limit. Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy had, on June 10, convened a meeting to study the food safety report and directed the officials to write to the Tamil Nadu government. The high incidence of cancer in Kerala could partly be attributed to toxic vegetables from Tamil Nadu, Kerala had said in a meeting of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. More than 80% of the state’s vegetables come from neighbouring states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. According to K Anil Kumar, food safety joint commissioner, Kerala, who led the study, says that the report, attached to the letter to the Tamil Nadu government, lists evidences to back its finding that farming is nearly controlled by pesticide-manufacturers. Earlier, in response to a similar missive from Kerala, Tamil Nadu agricultural production commissioner Rakesh Lakhani had initiated surprise checks at vegetable farms and shops selling pesticides. An inter-state secretary level meeting has been planned next month to discuss the matter. Following the earlier communique between the officials, the Tamil Nadu government has responded that chemicals that are banned on national level will not be allowed within the state. Tamil Nadu may also initiate supply of organic manure to the farmers at subsidised rate to improve food safety at farm level. Vegetable wholesale dealers in Kerala, however, were not too happy at the state government’s suggestion to stop procuring toxic vegetables from Tamil Nadu. Their immediate reaction was that Kerala will face a vegetable shortage and the traders would lose their long-term suppliers. Dismissing the argument made by local traders, the chief minister had directed the officials that all efforts should be made to get the cooperation of the Tamil Nadu officials to wipe out the pesticide menace in food, as it was an issue with grave ramifications on the health of people of the two states.","The Kerala government has notified Tamil Nadu about vegetable samples from Tamil Nadu containing pesticide residues exceeding permissible limits, possibly contributing to Kerala's high cancer rates. Kerala's Food Safety Authority reported that over 80% of Kerala's vegetables come from neighboring states. The report, sent to Tamil Nadu, suggests farming is heavily reliant on pesticides. Tamil Nadu responded by banning nationally prohibited chemicals and plans to provide subsidized organic manure. However, Kerala wholesalers expressed concerns over potential vegetable shortages. Despite this, Kerala's chief minister emphasized cooperation with Tamil Nadu to address the pesticide issue, highlighting its serious health implications for both states.

The court’s query followed a plea hearing about the use of excessive force while disciplining errant prisoners. The officer told the court that instances of violence occur when the lodgings of hardened criminals are shifted or when they are questioned upon recovery of banned items, such as mobile phones, weapons and even drugs, from them. The Director Prisons will assist the court with a lengthier explanation on May 20, the next date of hearing in the case. Reforming the prison system in the national Capital — anywhere in the country for that matter — is akin to searching for the Holy Grail. There are 16 jails in Delhi. All are overcrowded and understaffed. The living conditions, standard of hygiene, availability of healthy diet and exercise are questionable. Lack of legal aid, overstay of undertrials or prisoners completing their terms and gangster-ism among inmates add to the problems. The overworked and underpaid employees are hardly in a mood to be human and civil. They are rarely trained to treat the prison as a centre for rehabilitation. Prisons, in the eyes of most jailors, are where convicts come to get punished. The AAP Government told the High Court in 2019 that it had implemented a brand new jail manual in the Delhi jails. The fact that the same court heard Tuesday’s plea three years later says a lot about the impact of the manual. The United Nations in a 2019 report said that overcrowding in jails and violent, or excessive, or illegal use of force by jail officials to instil discipline contributes to increasing levels of violence. Excessive use of solitary confinement rarely makes the inmates obedient. Accountability for excesses by jail staff is low or non-existent. What purpose does a jail manual serve? A report of the Thailand Institute of Justice, ‘Global prison trends 2020’, said: “A prison service’s tasks include ensuring safety and security and organising everyday life in prison, ensuring treatment which does not infringe the human dignity of prisoners, offering meaningful occupational activities, interventions, thus preparing them for release and reintegration into society.” The tasks can be executed if the jail staff is educated, professionally trained and well paid with regular work hours. It is rare to see a jail official satisfied with the job. Many allegedly collude, play caste politics, encourage snitching and insider trading. We need a higher level of training in routine prison and prisoner management, criminology, law, social work and rehabilitation support. Otherwise, as the Delhi High Court said to the Tihar authorities in June 2021: “…it is because of these actions that people are avoiding extradition into our country. They go and say ‘look this is what happens in Indian prisons. People get beaten up. Don’t send me there’.","The Delhi High Court directed the Director General (Prisons) to improve management in Delhi’s jails to reduce violence and promote discipline. Issues include overcrowding, poor conditions, and inadequate staff training. The 2019 jail manual’s effectiveness remains questioned, with concerns about excessive force and inadequate rehabilitation.",Crime and Justice,2022-03-31 00:00:00
‘Doctored’ footage crucial evidence in Delhi Police report against JNU student Kanhaiya Kumar,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi Police report on the JNU development has cited four major grounds against Kanhaiya Kumar, the arrested students’ union president who is facing sedition charges. The most crucial evidence against him is a footage obtained from a private news channel that some claim is doctored. The latest report, submitted to Delhi Police Commissioner Bhim Sain Bassi, mentions shouting of 29 anti-India slogans at an event on February 9. But the list doesn’t include the slogan “Pakistan Zindabad”, which an FIR registered on February 11 based on the video footage said was shouted at the meeting. Among the other proofs the cops claimed include the statements by eyewitnesses who said Kumar was “present at Sabarmati (hostel) and Ganga Dhaba where this programme was organised and where a group of students were indulging in anti-national activities”. To support some of the claims, the police relied on the report of an internal JNU committee that probed the event. The committee found eight students, including Kumar, “misrepresented the facts about the proposed event as a cultural evening, although the objective was to hold a political meeting”. The report, which said the student leader “shouted unconstitutional slogans”, acknowledged that the investigation was at an initial stage and the police were collecting further evidences against Kumar. While the police have come under criticism over the way it handled the situation, the report stressed that they followed the rule book. It said the police “did not enter into the JNU complex without requisition from the concerned authorities”. Narrating the sequence of events, the south district police said they were informed about the cancellation of the permission to the students to hold the event inside the campus on February 9. “On receipt of information, a component of local police under the supervision of SHO Vasant Kunj (North) reached the gate of JNU campus and remained in touch with security officers of the JNU,” the report said. While defending its move, the Delhi Police said there was a group of 200-300 Left-affiliated students and 50-60 ABVP supporters. The police positioned themselves between the groups and were assisted by the security staff of the JNU, “who had made a human chain separating both the groups”, the report said.","The Delhi Police report on JNU implicates Kanhaiya Kumar based on video evidence allegedly showing anti-India slogans at a February 9 event.

With the flyway witnessing a massive snarl between 11am and 1pm and movement of vehicles paralyzed between Ashram Chowk and Film City, it took commuters two to three hours to cover the 7.5km stretch.

India drops plasma therapy from Covid treatment guidelines,"New Delhi : India on Monday dropped convalescent plasma therapy from the list of treatments suggested for Covid-19 following growing evidence that it did not benefit people who were infected in any way. The revised guidelines, jointly issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-Covid-19 National Task Force, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, and Union ministry of health and family welfare, no longer mentions it in the list of off-label or emergency use authorisation treatments. The technique is based on drawing blood from a person who has recovered after which plasma rich in Sars-Cov-2 antibodies is separated and pumped into a person still battling the infection. “ICMR has made it public in the past also that the therapy isn’t of much use based on the evidence that we have, and the earlier revised guidelines were also drastically modified for reference of those wanting to administer it, with clear cut do’s and don’ts.

"Himachal: RSS, ABVP call the shots in new BJP govt","With an organisation man Jai Ram Thakur’s rise as Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, the Rashtriya Swayam Sewak Sangh (RSS) and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarathi Parishad (ABVP) are calling the shots in new Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. Whether ministers, or other political appointments, the BJP men having roots in the organisation have got prominence in the government. The move has boosted the morale of BJP workers who, otherwise, have felt sidelined during previous BJP governments in the state. Out of total 11 ministers, five were active members of ABVP and had served the right-wing organisation’s student party before making foray into state politics. The ministers, who have organisational background are; Suresh Bhardwaj, Vipin Parmar, Virender Kanwar, Bikram Singh, Govind Singh Thakur and Rajiv Saijjal. These developments are considered to be well-thought out approach of Jai Ram Thakur who himself had been closely associated with ABVP and RSS. Thakur has himself served the ABVP as a full timer and has worked in other related organisations also. Apart from ministers, the top posts in CM’s office are also being awarded to those with ABVP and RSS. Immediately after the government was formed, the former office bearers of ABVP and party loyalists as Trilok Jamwal and Mahender Dharmani were appointed as Political Advisor and Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to CM respectively. While RSS worker Shishu Dharma has been given the post as OSD to CM, former ABVP office bearer Ashok Sharma has been appointed as the new Advocate General of the state. Party sources said the previous BJP governments in HP earlier facilitated the party workers in day to day activities, but they were neglected while giving appointments at top places. “During the previous regime, only experienced leaders used to get coveted posts. But the new BJP government under CM Jai Ram Thakur is choosing new and young faces who could work enthusiastically,” party officials said. “BJP has always promoted the party cadre and they were given prominence in organisation as well. But due to public scrutiny in the new regime, such appointments are being highlighted,” state BJP chief Satpal Singh Satti told The Statesman. “This would boost the party cadres who work selflessly and would ultimately strengthen the organisation,” he said. The BJP’s move to appoint young faces from the organisation are seen in the light of the vision of party’s top leadership, including BJP chief Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra, who have time and again, had asserted to bring younger faces in the organisation and government, who could help BJP repeat in power in future.","In the new BJP government in Himachal Pradesh, RSS and ABVP members are being given prominence in key positions, including ministers, top posts in CM's office, and the Advocate Generalship.

The BJP says that this is to promote young and enthusiastic party workers, and to strengthen the organization. However, some critics have pointed out that this could lead to a concentration of power in the hands of a few, and could undermine the autonomy of the government.",Miscellaneous,2018-01-01 00:00:00
Did U.S. deploy super secret stealth helicopters for Osama raid?,"Did the world just get an inadvertent ‘tail boom' glimpse of a super secret stealth helicopter? That's the question being hotly debated in defence technology circles across the internet, with wonks and geeks poring over photographs of the tell-tale evidence left behind by the U.S. special forces who swooped in to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan this week. The silent post-midnight operation by the Navy SEALs — who flew across the Afghanistan border into Abbottabad without even setting off a minor blimp on Pakistani radar screens and made an equally smooth exit some 40 minutes later — was flawless except for the loss of one helicopter. In the midst of their high-jinks mission, however, the U.S. forces took care to blow up the downed helo. Soon after the operation, military experts were of the view that U.S. helicopters managed to evade detection by deploying electronic counter measures that jam radars. On its part, Islamabad stated that the choppers entered Pakistani airspace making use of ‘nap of the earth' flying techniques and blind spots in radar coverage due to hilly terrain. Lone clue With the United States unwilling to share greater details about the operation, defence analysts have relied on the lone visible clue — the tail boom — of the helicopter destroyed by the U.S forces after it was damaged. The metal scrap lying in the compound of the building where Osama was found and killed remains as a mute and mangled witness to the successful operation. Military aviation enthusiasts have based their theory of a new stealth helicopter around the photograph of this metallic piece. “It was a secretly developed stealth helicopter, probably a highly modified version of an H-60 Blackhawk. Photos published...show that the helicopter's tail features stealth-configured shapes on the boom and tip fairings, swept stabilizers and a ‘dishpan' cover over a non-standard five-or-six-blade tail rotor. It has a silver-loaded infra-red suppression finish similar to that seen on some V-22s,” wrote Avres, identified as a defence technology blogger, on Aviation Week. Quoting a retired special operations aviator, Army Times said the helicopters were a radar-evading variant of the special operations MH-60 Black Hawk. The helicopter's low-observable technology is similar to that of the F-117 Stealth Fighter, the retired special operations aviator said. “It really didn't look like a traditional Black Hawk,” he said. It had “hard edges, sort of like an … F-117, you know how they have those distinctive edges and angles — that's what they had on this one,” the website quoted this unnamed aviator as saying. In addition, “in order to keep the radar cross-section down, you have to do something to treat the windshield,” he said. If a special coating was applied to the windshield it is “very plausible” that would make the helicopter more difficult to fly for pilots wearing night-vision goggles, he said. This is being seen as one of the possible reasons for the helicopter crashing. And considering the top-secret nature of the platform, the SEALs chose to waste valuable time destroying it. The Pentagon has refused to comment on questions about the Blackhawks used in the Bin Laden raid. Dan Goure, a former Pentagon official now with the Lexington Institute think tank, told ABC News: “This is a first. You wouldn't know that it was coming right at you. And that's what's important, because these are coming in fast and low, and if they aren't sounding like they're coming right at you, you might not even react until it's too late ... That was clearly part of the success.” With neither official confirmation nor denial forthcoming, the speculation is bound to continue. The only thing certain is that air strategists and planners around the world will have one more imponderable to work on. What next?","Following the successful Navy SEAL operation to eliminate Osama bin Laden, speculation has arisen regarding the use of a stealth helicopter. Despite the Pentagon's silence, military experts and enthusiasts have analyzed photographs of a destroyed helicopter's tail boom, suggesting it may be a stealth variant of the MH-60 Black Hawk. Characteristics such as stealth-configured shapes and radar-evading technology have led to comparisons with the F-117 Stealth Fighter. The secrecy surrounding the operation and the destruction of the helicopter add to the intrigue, leaving the world pondering the implications of this new technology in military strategy.",International News,2011-05-05 00:00:00
"Extremist, separatist forces outside India should not get space: Jaishankar on US temple vandalism","External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday expressed concern over the vandalism of a Hindu temple with anti-India graffiti in the US, and said extremists and separatist forces outside India should not get such space. He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the third convocation of the Rashtriya Raksha University here. ""I have seen the news. As you know, we are concerned about this. Extremists and separatist forces outside India should not get space. Our consulate has lodged a complaint with the (US) government and the police there over whatever happened, and I believe the matter is being inquired,"" Jaishankar said in response to a query about the incident. The police department in Newark, California said that approximately 8.35 am on Friday, they received a report of graffiti at Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu temple. According to images posted on social media, the word 'Khalistan' was spray-painted on a signpost outside the temple along with other objectionable graffiti. The Newark police said any acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation, or other crimes motivated by hate or bias are considered very serious and given very high priority. The Consulate General of India in San Francisco strongly condemned the defacing of the temple. Talking about the arrest of Nikhil Gupta in Czech Republic over accusation that he was planning to assassinate US-based pro-Khalistan activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in collaboration with an Indian official, the Union minister said the Indian embassy was provided consular access to him (by that country's government). ""Whenever an Indian citizen is arrested, we seek consular access for their care which we have received thrice,"" he said. Over the absence of USA and Canada from the list of partner countries for the 10th Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit, Jaishankar said he would not put any political meaning to this. ""At the government level, it depends who we invite...The government of Gujarat can answer (over invitation to the countries). I would not put any political meaning,"" the minister said. ""My understanding is opposite, which is that in fact many counties are calling us to participate in Vibrant Gujarat. We ask them to talk to the government of Gujarat.

Goldman model evokes ancient Egypt's bloodsucking leeches,": Macroeconomics really is stuck in the Dark Ages. Take ""fiscal stimulus,"" for example, the idea that the government can step in to fill the void when the private sector isn't spending and boost economic growth in the process. Economists have been debating the pros and cons of fiscal stimulus since the 1930s, when John Maynard Keynes diagnosed the problem as one of inadequate private investment and prescribed public spending, financed by borrowing, as the cure. The discussion hasn't advanced much in eight decades. Sure, economists have devised elegant mathematical models that purport to show that $1 of government purchases translates into - take your pick - no increase in GDP (the multiplier is zero, according to Harvard's Robert Barro) or $1.50 of GDP (a multiplier of 1.5, according to Berkeley's Christina Romer, who was chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers when the $814-billion stimulus was crafted in 2009). They haven't really proven anything. Want a Loan? Get cash against your Mutual Funds in 4 hours Keynesian economics went into hibernation in the latter part of the 20th century following an array of stimulus failures on the part of both Democratic and Republican administrations in the 1970s. The only thing the spending stimulated was stagflation. All it took was a financial crisis for the Keynesians to come out of the woodwork. The debate over fiscal stimulus went viral last week (at least in the geek world) with an economic forecast from Goldman Sachs Group, a counter from Stanford University economist John Taylor (he of the Taylor rule), and an addenda from Goldman. The Goldman gang projected an economic drag (the opposite of stimulus) on GDP growth of 1.5 to 2 percentage points in the second and third quarters if House-passed budget cuts of $61 billion for the remainder of fiscal 2011 become the law of the land. Asked about the Goldman forecast, Fed chief Ben Bernanke demurred. ""Our analysis doesn't get a number quite like that,"" he said. In a February 28 blog post, Taylor said Goldman's analysis was ""wrong"". He criticised it for failing to consider the beneficial effects that expectations of lower future deficits and smaller tax increases would have on the economy. He criticised the methodology for relying on the same ""large multiplier theory"" used to justify the 2009 stimulus. And he criticised the assumption that proposed spending equates with actual spending, which trickles out over time. Aside from that, Mrs Lincoln, the Goldman analysis was spot on. This fundamental disagreement among professional economists about whether government spending helps or hurts represents the state of the art, or science, today. There are no control studies in economics, no way to hold everything else constant to determine the impact of one variable, no way to falsify conclusions that models spit out.","The debate over fiscal stimulus in macroeconomics remains stagnant since Keynesian economics emerged in the 1930s. Recent discussions involve conflicting views on the efficacy of government spending to boost economic growth. Despite sophisticated mathematical models, economists disagree on the impact, with some suggesting no GDP increase while others argue for a multiplier effect. Keynesian ideas resurfaced after the financial crisis, yet disagreements persist. Recent debates, sparked by Goldman Sachs' forecast and rebuttals, highlight the ongoing uncertainty. The lack of consensus underscores the limitations of economic modeling and the complexity of evaluating fiscal policies' effectiveness.",Business and Finance,2011-03-25 00:00:00

The youth will be trained and placed in multi-faith pairs within development and faith organisations to build partnerships among people of different faiths. The 2011-12 fellowship will focus on maternal health and child mortality. The deadline for the applications is December 31 and four fellows -- aged between 20 and 27 years -- are expected to be shortlisted this year from India. ""We would like young people who are inspired by their own faith, are motivated with a leadership potential and most importantly need to have experience in social service,"" Hannah Wallace, from TBFF, said. The candidates will be trained and based in urban and rural poverty projects in Delhi, working with diverse communities to tackle poverty. They will participate in a month-long residential training course in London, learning alongside their peers, and will be attached to an NGO for 11 months where they will work in raising funds, increasing awareness and involving other people in social work. The first year of the fellowship which operated in the US, UK and Canada was a huge success: educating 40,000 people about the UN Millennium Development Goals, inspiring over 14,000 people of different faiths to act together, raising over 200,000 pounds to help eradicate deaths caused by malaria. Speaking about the fellowship former UK PM Tony Blair said, ""India and its people have so much to teach the world of interfaith; it is a living, breathing example of the concept of interfaith with so many different cultures and faiths having lived together side by side for hundreds of years. The Indian people have experienced the tensions and opportunities that such diversity brings and will help inform and enrich the fellowship. It is my hope that we will see a generation of young Indians come forward and respond to the opportunity that the fellowship brings.","The Tony Blair Faith Foundation (TBFF) launches a fellowship program in India to empower young faith-driven leaders to combat poverty. The year-long international program trains and pairs fellows from India with those from other countries to work within diverse communities in India. Focusing on maternal health and child mortality in 2011-12, fellows will be placed with NGOs and receive training in London. The program seeks applicants aged 20-27 with social service experience and leadership potential. Tony Blair highlights India's rich interfaith history as a valuable asset to the program.",Social Devalopment,2010-11-07 00:00:00
Queen gives assent for Britain to leave European Union,"Queen Elizabeth II gave her formal assent on Thursday for Britain to end its decades-long involvement in the European Union and seek a more independent but uncertain future at the end of the month. The head of state’s ceremonial approval of the withdrawal legislation allows Britain to leave its closest neighbours and trading partners after years of bickering and three delays.Two top EU officials in Brussels are expected to sign the separation treaty on Friday and Prime Minister Boris Johnson—the pro-Brexit figurehead of Britain’s seismic 2016 referendum—will put his name on it in the coming days. “At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we’ve done it,” Johnson said after both houses of the British parliament ratified the withdrawal bill on Wednesday.“Now we can put the rancour and division of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future.” The January 31 split caps a remarkable political comeback for Johnson at one of the most difficult points in Britain’s post-war history. He quit former prime minister Theresa May’s government in 2018 in protest at what he viewed as her pro-European separation terms. Johnson returned as May’s successor in July last year and has since managed to negotiate his own deal with Brussels and regain the government’s control of parliament in a risky early election last month. The rest was a formality. Lawmakers barely debated the withdrawal agreement before passing it—even though critics called it worse for Britain than the one reached by May. Johnson will celebrate his victory by issuing commemorative coins and chairing a special cabinet meeting in England’s pro-Brexit north on January 31. Johnson will now be responsible for defining the terms on which Britain trades and shares everything from data to fishing waters with the remaining 27 EU member states. EU officials say this will give Britain an unfair advantage and are threatening to retaliate with tariffs and quotas that could hit the UK auto and pharmaceutical industries especially hard. European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said the bloc’s financial system was ready for the next stage. “There can always be a risk somewhere,” she said in Frankfurt. “But I think in good conscience we have covered everything that we thought was necessary.” Some analysts believe Johnson is prepared to pay the price of short-term economic damage in order to deliver on pledge to “get Brexit done”. He argues that greater flexibility will help him reach a quick post-Brexit agreement with the United States and other nations that are growing much faster than those in Europe. US officials say they are eager to strike a deal with Johnson. An agreement “is an absolute priority for President (Donald) Trump and we expect to complete that with them this year,” US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said ahead of his arrival in London this weekend. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross added that Johnson would have an easier time with Washington than Brussels because “there are far fewer issues between the UK and US”. Johnson is expected to lay out his vision for the post-Brexit agreement with Brussels in a big policy address early next month. “Once we have left the EU in just over a week’s time we’ll be free to start having discussions with countries around the world including the US,” Downing Street said on Wednesday. — AFP","Queen Elizabeth II has given her formal assent for Britain to end its decades-long involvement in the European Union, marking a historic moment as the UK is set to leave the EU on January 31.

On energy and resources,"Ahead, you’ll see that this certainly isn’t a book for alternative energy. Neither is this a book against it. In fact, we won’t be talking in simplistic terms of for and against, left and right, good and evil. Ahead, we’ll interrogate the very idea of being for or against energy technologies at all. Consider, for instance, America’s extensive automotive transportation system that, alongside impressive benefits, yields a host of negative side effects such as smog, particulates, CO2 and deadly accidents. Our politicians, corporations, universities and the media open their palms to show us an array of biofuel, electric and hydrogen vehicles as alternatives. Even though these vehicles might not emit toxic fumes directly, their manufacture, maintenance and disposal do… When I speak on energy, the most frequent questions I receive are variants of “What energy technology is best?” — as if there is a straightforward answer. Every energy technology causes aches and pains; shifting to alternative energy represents nothing more than ashift to alternative aches and pain. The seductive tales of wind turbines, solar cells and biofuels…lull us into dreams of a clean energy future juxtaposed against a tumultuous past characterised by evil oil companies and the associated energy woes they propagated. Like most fairy tales, this productivist parable contains atiny bit of truth. And a whole lot of fantasy.","The passage challenges simplistic views on energy technologies, avoiding binary judgments of good versus bad. It critiques the shift to alternative energies like biofuels and electric vehicles, highlighting their own environmental impacts in production and disposal. The narrative questions the narrative of a clean energy future versus a troubled past with fossil fuels, suggesting that every energy technology comes with its own set of challenges and trade-offs. It urges readers to reconsider the complexities and consequences of energy choices beyond idealized narratives of progress.",Environment,2013-10-23 00:00:00
"India aim for semifinal, Pakistan eye survival","Dubai, Feb 22: Hyped as a marquee showdown but mostly lopsided on the field, India and Pakistan lock horns in the ICC Champions Trophy here on Sunday with Rohit Sharma’s men aiming to seal a semifinal spot and Mohammad Rizwan’s team desperate to avoid early elimination from the tournament. While India are on a high after claiming a measured six-wicket win over a sprightly Bangladesh, Pakistan are evidently tense after the 60-run loss in the tournament-opener against New Zealand. The sub-continental rivals’ last Champion Trophy clash was the 2017 final in which Pakistan walked away with the win and the trophy. Rizwan and Co. would look to draw inspiration from that triumph in London but would also need to scale up their performance in every department. Though the buzz surrounding the match is nowhere close to being what it used to be at the peak of diplomatic tensions between the two countries, there is an air of quiet anticipation for the Group A clash at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. India will have a distinct advantage in every aspect. The side has settled in nicely while Pakistan have flown in a couple of days ago after the drubbing handed by the Black Caps in Karachi. More often than not, an India-Pakistan clash is as much a battle of nerves as cricketing abilities and India would be in a much better space on both counts come Sunday afternoon. For starters, skipper Rohit, whose form was a major concern in the run-up to the tournament, seems to be getting back to his best if the lucid stroke-making against Bangladesh was anything to go by. His 41-run cameo was a crucial contribution in the tricky chase of 229 which was masterfully anchored by Shubman Gill with his eighth ODI hundred. In contrast, Pakistan would be fretting over the form and approach of their biggest star Babar Azam. The 90-ball 64 against New Zealand in a chase of 320 has been roundly criticised for being too slow. Azam’s inability to accelerate even when the asking rate kept climbing has come under scrutiny and he would be under tremendous pressure against India. Adding to their woes is the injury-forced ouster of game-changing opener Fakhar Zaman from the squad. Imam ul Haq has replaced him in the side and has joined the squad here. However, middle-order batter Khushdil Shah’s counter-attacking 69 in the tournament-opener is a positive. Shah has amusingly stated that he has no idea how he made the squad given his lean run in the recent past but Pakistan would be happy that the punt has paid off. Pakistan would also be hoping to prove a point by getting the better of India, who refused to travel across the border for the tournament which is otherwise wholly scheduled in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. The man who is feeling the heat in the Indian team right now is Virat Kohli after yet again failing to convert a fairly decent start. His focus hasn’t looked the same for a while but Kohli does have the knack of coming up with special efforts against Pakistan. However, in the larger scheme of things, it could well boil down to key defining moments from the bowlers and here too Pakistan have lots to ponder after the hammering that the Shaheen Afridi-led attack took from the Kiwis. (PTI)","India and Pakistan will face off in the ICC Champions Trophy, with India aiming for a semifinal spot and Pakistan desperate to avoid early elimination. India is coming off a win against Bangladesh, while Pakistan is reeling from a loss to New Zealand. India has the advantage in form, with captain Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill in good shape. In contrast, Pakistan's Babar Azam is under pressure for slow batting, and the team is dealing with injuries, including Fakhar Zaman's exclusion. Key moments from bowlers will be crucial, with Pakistan's attack needing improvement after a poor performance.",Sports,2025-02-22 00:00:00

4 held after Sarita Vihar encounter,"NEW DELHI: The south district police have arrested four criminals after an encounter on Mathura road in Sarita Vihar. According to the police, the accused had robbed an MNC executive of his car near PVR Saket, on December 19.

Legal suit filed against Kangana's character in Rangoon,"Just a week ahead of its release, news is out that director Vishal Bhardwaj's Rangoon starring Shahid Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut and Saif Ali Khan is caught up in legal trouble.Film production company Wadia Movietone Pvt. Ltd. has reportedly filed a commercial suit against Vishal Bhardwaj and others in the Mumbai High Court on grounds of copyright infringement.According to a report in Mid-Day, Roy Wadia on behalf of Wadia Movietone Pvt. Ltd. has claimed that Miss Julia, the character of Kangana Ranaut - a strong stuntwoman - is based on real-life Australian stunt actor Mary Evans, popularly known in India and around the world as Fearless Nadia.Wadia's firm hold rights to all scripts, publicity material and posters for the Fearless Nadia films it has produced.

Ltd. alleges that Rangoon's makers have carried out a ""breach of trust.""Back in 2006, Ronnie Screwvala of UTV was approached by Roy Wadia to make a film on Nadia. Things did not work out but soon news emerged that Vishal Bhardwaj was making a similar film for UTV.UTV and Vishal Bhardwaj told Roy Wadia that their film, then-titled Julia, was not inspired by the story of Fearless Nadia. Later, Wadia learned that the film was shelved. In 2008, Wadia signed an agreement with a German firm that it could use all of Wadias' copyrighted material on Fearless Nadia to make a film on her.Seven years later, Roy Wadia got news that a film called Rangoon was being made and that it was supposedly based around Nadia's life. Wadia told the film's makers that the rights to Fearless Nadia's character and story were with a German firm and if Vishal and co. still went ahead with Rangoon, they could land in legal trouble. Disney UTV (then, headed by Siddharth Roy Kapur) assured Wadia and the German firm that the film wouldn't be made.Then in 2016, while Vishal was making Rangoon with Sajid Nadiadwala, Vishal assured Roy Wadia that his film was a love story set in the backdrop of World War II and was not remotely inspired by Nadia's life. UTV Disney by then was not in the picture.When Wadia finally saw the film's promos in 2017, he realised that Kangana's character Julia was indeed inspired from the life of Fearless Nadia.Watch Rangoon trailer here:Now, the suit comes up for hearing in Mumbai High Court on February 20.While the Rangoon camp has been quiet about this since the matter is sub-judice, a member from Rangoon's cast, requesting anonymity said, ""Kangana was advised to watch Hunterwali (a famous 1935 Fearless Nadia stunt film), and the stylists told to reference her dressing for Kangana, who plays Julia.

Court drops all charges against a Thai woman in a 2015 bombing at a Bangkok shrine that killed 20,"A court in Thailand on Thursday (November 7, 2024) acquitted a Thai woman who had been charged with involvement in a 2015 bombing at a shrine in Bangkok that killed 20 people and injured 120. Wanna Suansan was one of three people apprehended out of 17 suspects who authorities said were responsible for the blast at Erawan Shrine, a popular tourist destination, particularly for visitors from China. The Bangkok Southern Criminal Court ruled that there was not enough evidence to link her to the bombing. Police arrest foreigner in Bangkok shrine bombing case The two others being tried separately are ethnic Uyghurs, a Muslim minority in China that has suffered repression. All three were charged with a variety of offences, including murder, attempted murder and illegal possession of explosive materials. The two Uyghurs were arrested in 2015 shortly after the bombing on Aug. 17. Ms. Suansan was arrested later when she voluntarily returned to Thailand from Turkey in 2017 to turn herself in when she was named as a suspect. Thai authorities have said the bombing was revenge by a people-smuggling gang whose activities had been disrupted by the police. Thailand cracked down on human traffickers earlier in 2015 after abandoned camps for Rohingyas fleeing persecution in Myanmar and economic migrants from Bangladesh were found in the jungles along the Thai-Malaysia border. Thailand indicts two for deadly Bangkok bombing However, some analysts suspect the bombing was the work of Uyghur separatists angry that Thailand had forcibly repatriated scores of Uyghurs to China in July that year. Many Uyghurs try to escape persecution and tight control in China with the help of professional smugglers. The shrine’s popularity among Chinese tourists lent support to the theory that the bombing had a political element. While the two other suspects, Yusufu Mieraili and Bilal Mohammad, were allegedly linked by video, DNA and other evidence to the bombing, the case against Ms. Suansan was more circumstantial. Ms. Suansan, 36, was accused of leasing accommodation for the alleged bombers. Police said they found gunpowder, fertilizer and other bomb-making materials in an apartment in outer Bangkok that was leased under Ms. Suansan’s name. The Judge on Thursday (November 7, 2024) said there was not enough evidence indicating that Ms. Suansan had committed a crime as she was charged. She said prosecutors could not provide evidence that Ms. Suansan was present at the site of the bombing, had brought the other suspects there or helped them escape. There was also no evidence that she had contact with them or helped them acquire explosive materials that were found in the apartment, which she was alleged to have rented for the suspects, the judge said. She said it might have been possible that Ms. Suansan helped find accommodation for friends or acquaintances of her husband, who is Turkish, but prosecutors could not prove what kind of relationship her husband might have had with the other suspects. Her husband, not in custody, is another suspect in the case. Some of the suspects are Turks, with whom Uyghurs share ethnic bonds. “Today the court acquitted the charges. I’m very happy. I’d like to thank the court, because I had been waiting for this day for seven years since I returned,” Ms. Suansan said after the ruling. She said that during that time, she felt discouraged because “it’s like I didn’t get any justice, and it also damaged my family.” Mieraili and Bilal, accused of being the main bombers, have faced repeated delays in their trial because of difficulties in finding suitable translators. Their lawyer, Chuchart Kanpai, said on Thursday (Nov. 7) that their case was still at the stage of examining witnesses, and the next court date is scheduled for March. The two men pleaded not guilty when their trial began in 2016 and said they suffered mistreatment and torture in jail after their arrests. Police said they believe Mieraili detonated the bomb minutes after a backpack containing the device was allegedly left at the shrine by Bilal, who is also known as Adem Karadag.","On November 7, 2024, a Thai court acquitted Wanna Suansan, one of 17 suspects charged in the 2015 Bangkok shrine bombing that killed 20 and injured 120.

However, the judge stated that there was no proof of her involvement in the bombing, her presence at the site, or any direct contact with the suspects. Her Turkish husband, also a suspect, remains at large. The bombing has been linked either to human traffickers retaliating against a Thai crackdown or to Uyghur separatists angered by Thailand’s forced repatriation of Uyghurs to China. Two other suspects, ethnic Uyghurs Yusufu Mieraili and Bilal Mohammad (a.k.a. Adem Karadag), are being tried separately. They are allegedly tied to the bombing through video, DNA, and physical evidence, but their trial has been repeatedly delayed due to translation issues.

Mahamana’s vision of nation building,"A great patriot, a supreme architect of the temple of learning at Kashi, an eminent educationist, a teacher of teachers, a silver-tongued transcendental orator, an ancient as well as a modern leader, a reluctant but an eminent lawyer, a social reformer, a great human, a torch-bearer of the downtrodden, and above all a great nation builder, Malaviyaji lived for us and future generations.His vision is embedded in its unique architectural layout and its content: a magnificent silhouette against the Gangetic sky at dawn with gothic pillars --Banaras Hindu University(BHU).Mahatma Gandhi compared Tilak to the lofty Himalaya, Gokhale to the deep sea and Malaviya to the crystal-clear sacred river in which he decided to have ablution. He aptly called Malaviyaji as ‘Devata Purush’ (a man of God). Malaviyaji rendered a long and remarkable service to his motherland. He began his life as a teacher with a sustained and inspiring utterance in any cause with constructive and humanitarian appeal. A distinguished journalist and a legal luminary, he gave up a lucrative practice for ‘whole time’ public work.Could the Harijans, as they were called, be reclaimed into the Hindu fold? It was no fault of the Harjans that they were born of certain Harjan parents. Malaviyaji pleaded passionately for the removal of untouchability. To him, God was ‘love’, and asked his fellowmen to love one another. He started the ‘Shuddhi Movement’ through ‘Mantra Diksha’ to abolish the blemish of untouchability.Malaviyaji’s work for the upliftment of thewomenis both remarkable and notable.

The second was the backwardness of the economic development for which he appealed for popular enterprise and initiative as well as a broad-based state policy.

"Post FDI, govt to push graft, banking Bills","New Delhi, December 9 Fresh from securing approval of Parliament on the contentious FDI in retail trade, the Manmohan Singh Government plans to test its fortunes on pushing forward legislative agenda, including reforms in financial sector, anti-graft measures and a Constitutional Amendment Bill to provide for reservation in promotion with the latter proving to be a challenge. The Government has listed a clutch of Bills in either House of Parliament for discussion and passage with Monday's list of business showing the Lok Sabha scheduled to consider the Banking Law (Amendment) Bill that seeks to exempt bank mergers from the scrutiny of Competition Commission of India and allow RBI to approve it. It also proposes that voting rights of shareholders of private banks be made proportionate to their shareholding rights as against existing ceiling of 10 per cent. The Bill has been scrutinised by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance headed by Yashwant Sinha (BJP) and the Government is pinning its hope that with the support of the principal party in the opposition the Bill can be passed even though the Left parties are opposed to it. “We will have to see if the BJP now supports the Government, in which case it will expose BJP's hypocrisy”, said CPI leader D Raja told. Having successfully piloted the Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill in the Lok Sabha on November 29, the Finance Minister is scheduled to move it for consideration and passage by the Rajya Sabha on Monday. Among other things, it proposed to expand the definition of offence to include activities like concealment, acquisition, possession and the use of proceeds of crime. However, much would depend on whether the upper house can function without disruption since the Government has listed the Constitutional Amendment (117th) Bill for tomorrow once again. Previous attempts have sparked protests from the Samajwadi Party which is opposed to the proposal to provide for reservation to scheduled castes/scheduled tribes in promotions. Although the Bill was introduced in the monsoon session in the Rajya Sabha, there has been no forward movement on the proposed legislation that the BSP chief Mayawati has been insisting be passed and her party is lobbying for support. Earlier this year in the M Nagaraj versus Union of India case, the Supreme Court struck down validity of earlier constitutional amendments observing that concerned state will have to show in each case the existence of the compelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of representation and overall administrative efficiency before making provision for reservation in promotion. The Government has said there is difficulty in collection of quantifiable data showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation of that class in public employment and that there is uncertainty on the methodology of this exercise. The other Bill on the list of business includes Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill passed by the Lok Sabha on November 30. In the Lok Sabha, the Government plans to move the Prevention of Bribery of Foreign Public Officials and Officials of International Organisations Bill in line with its international obligation as a signatory to United National Convention against Corruption on December 9, 2005 observed as Anti-Corruption Day. OTHER MEASURES UNDER REVIEW Lok Sabha is scheduled to consider the Banking Law (Amendment) Bill that seeks to exempt bank mergers from the scrutiny of Competition Commission of India. Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill having been passed in the Lok Sabha on November 29, the Finance Minister is scheduled to move it for consideration and passage by the Rajya Sabha Prevention of Bribery of Foreign Public Officials and Officials of International Organisations Bill, which the Government plans to move in the Lok Sabha. SP-BSP CLASH ON THE CARDS The Government has listed the Constitutional Amendment (117th) Bill for Monday. Previous attempts have sparked protests from the SP which is opposed to the proposal to provide for reservation to scheduled castes/scheduled tribes in promotions. The BSP chief Mayawati has been insisting that the BIll be passed and her party is lobbying for support.","The Indian government, following the approval of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail trade, aims to advance its legislative agenda, including financial sector reforms, anti-graft measures, and a Constitutional Amendment Bill for reservation in promotions.

AR Rahman recalls creating music for Jab Tak Hai Jaan,"Jab Tak Hai Jaan, the last film directed by the late Yash Chopra, was released eight years ago on this day. The Diwali 2012 release starring Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma is still recalled for the unforgettable songs AR Rahman scored for the film. From ""Challa"" and ""Ishq shava"" to ""Saans"" and ""Heer"", the film had some of the best compositions in the career of Rahman. Recalling composing tracks for the film, music maestro AR Rahman shared what a memorable experience he had working with Yash Chopra and lyricist Gulzar. ""It was a great honour working with such a stalwart. He (Yash Chopra) had this child-like enthusiasm about everything that was fascinating. Knowing that he was the visionary behind YRF Studios and movies, it was quite interesting to see how organised they were. You expect certain things from such an experienced person, but then he always picks the most innovative idea! He had that extra quality in him to pick new things and yet ground it in tradition,"" Rahman said. The composer also spoke about how he used to break Ramadan fast with Yash Chopra and Gulzar on the sets of the film. On Gulzar, he said there was poetry about everything he did from ""the way he gestures and the way he talks"" adding that ""his eyes are filled with love and wisdom"". ""It was interesting to work with both of them. Sometimes, we would work and break the Ramadan fast together, all three of us. So, it was really cool that way,"" he added. Rahman listed his favourite song from the film, too. ""I think it's ‘Heer heer'. Because that's one song with which they gave me a lot of freedom. They just gave me the lyrics and said, 'this is a filler song. We just need 30 seconds of it'. Once we recorded it, Yashji asked me, 'You're not Punjabi. How come you got all the Punjabi nuances?' I said, 'you don't have to live in Punjab to compose a Punjabi song. Because in India, we're all interconnected, you know? Our traditions are interconnected and we value each other. We respect each other's cultures'. So, that actually turns into an influence, too. It has a vibe but it's still not the typical one,"" Rahman recalled.","*Jab Tak Hai Jaan*, the last film directed by Yash Chopra, released during Diwali 2012, starred Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif, and Anushka Sharma.

"Israel, Palestine engage in ‘difficult’ talks","Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Cairo were today locked in “difficult” talks to find a long-term solution to the crisis in Gaza, even as the 72-hour truce took hold for the second day allowing people in the Hamas-ruled area to fix the destruction. “We are facing difficult negotiations. The first truce passed without notable achievements. This is the second and final cease-fire,” Palestinian news agency Ma’an quoted Mousa Abu Marzouk as saying. Last week, Hamas refused to extend a first 72-hour halt in fighting with Israel unless their demands, particularly the opening of border crossings with Gaza and the construction of a seaport, were met. An Israeli official told Israel Radio that there had been no progress in the talks so far, as the gaps between the sides remained too vast. Israeli officials said that another 72 hours were needed to cement a long-term cease-fire deal with Hamas. The radio station reported that the delegation was expected to agree to ease some restrictions in Gaza, including extending fishing rights, increasing the number of materials that enter Gaza, along with Israel allowing funds to enter the Strip to be used to pay the salaries of Hamas officials. The Israeli delegation said that it was not going to give any concessions regarding Hamas’ demands to open a seaport and airport in Gaza, Jerusalem Post reported.","Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are engaged in challenging talks in Cairo to resolve the Gaza crisis during a second 72-hour truce.

Kashmir accession complete (1952),"In a 40-minute speech in the House of the People today (June 26) Mr Nehru explained various aspects of the Kashmir problem and, in reply to excited speeches from the Opposition, declared that it was for the people of Kashmir to settle their future. The final decision lay with them since the alternative was compulsion or coercion. Did anyone in the House want to coerce the people of Kashmir, he asked. The debate took place during discussion on the States Ministry’s demands for grants which were hurriedly voted at the end of the sitting. There was a good deal of excitement caused partly by demonstrations outside the House. The demonstrators’ views were reflected in the speeches of Dr S. P. Mookerjee and Mr N. C. Chatterjee. Mr Chatterjee took a legalistic view. He argued that Kashmir could not be a republic within a republic and that it could not have a flag of its own. If either of these things was allowed, it would be an outrage on the Constitution. He was downright in his criticism. The Government had bungled all along in handling Kashmir, and they seemed to be doing no better now. Dr Mookerjee started on a reasonable note. He admitted that nothing should be said that would help Pakistan or go against India’s case before the U.N. and expressed anxiety to settle the issues raised of Kashmir’s Constituent Assembly. But emotion soon got the better of him and he began to allege communalism under Sheikh Abdullah. He talked of oppressive laws, suppression of the Press and communalism in the State’s language policy.","In a 40-minute address to the House of the People, Mr. Nehru discussed the Kashmir issue, emphasizing that the people of Kashmir must determine their own future.

"Commercial activities comes to a standstill in Dimapur, Kohima, Wokha and Chümoukedima","DIMAPUR/Kohima/Wokha, APRIL 26 (MExN):All commercial activities in Dimapur came to a complete halt on April 26 as the indefinite shutter down called by the Dimapur Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) came into effect across the district. Along with Dimapur, all shops and business establishments also downed shutters in the districts of Chümoukedima, Kohima and Wokha in solidarity with the DCCI. Barring light vehicular movement, the streets in these four districts wore a deserted look, reminiscent of the COVID-19 lockdowns a few years earlier. Travelling around Dimapur, it was observed that barring government offices, educational institutions, banks, local taxi services and hospitals, all other activities stopped functioning on day 1. The shutter down was observed peacefully without any sort of untoward incident as reported by area volunteers stationed in several locations to monitor the closure of shops beginning from 6:00 AM onwards. Levito Swu, media secretary of New Market Business Owners Association informed that more than 1300 shops were closed under their jurisdiction, in accordance with the directive by DCCI. “All of them have been cooperating with us,” he said. Swu expressed frustration at the way multiple-taxation has affected the livelihoods of the people, placing a heavy burden especially on the common citizens. “Now there are more than 22 groups in Nagaland, each of their tax has a direct impact on the prices of goods and other commodities,” he mentioned. Besides the NPG’s imposition of taxation, he also pointed to the unwarranted practice of asking donations, buying lottery tickets etc on the traders in the area. “All these have a cascading affect on the health of the business in Dimapur,” he noted. At Hazi Park area, which has around 700 shops, members of the Hazi Park Business Welfare Committee appreciated the bold step taken by DCCI to initiate the closure of all businesses. “We along with all shops in our jurisdiction fully back their demands and are ready to continue on with the shutter down,” they highlighted. The KCCI extended solidarity with the DCCI by enforcing shutter down in the state capital Kohima from 6 AM to 6 PM. It was a peaceful one, said KCCI general secretary Henry Chisüte while briefing media persons. Certain commercials outlets like pharmacies, hotels and bakeries were exempted from the purview of Thursday’s closure. “We should all hope and pray for the best to get a positive response from the Government so that this closure may come to a fruition, he said.

RRI scientists find new approach to explore nature of cold dark matter,"Bengaluru: Scientists from the Bengaluru-based Raman Research Institute (RRI) have found a new approach to explore the nature of cold dark matter (CDM), an elusive form of matter believed to make up 25% of the universe. In a recently published study, RRI professor Shiv Sethi and his collaborator Abineet Parichha demonstrated that weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) remain a promising candidate for CDM if certain assumptions about their stability are relaxed. Previously, models from particle physics that predicted stable WIMPs were at odds with cosmological models and experimental constraints regarding dark matter interactions. By considering unstable WIMPs that decay into particles, including a component that serves as CDM in the late universe, the researchers expanded the range of allowed WIMP properties. “We found that the WIMP model is still viable under the relaxed assumptions. In addition, data from the James Webb Space Telescope might reveal more exciting possibilities in the dark matter sector,” Prof Sethi, a senior astronomer at RRI, an autonomous institute of the department of science and technology (DST), said. The nature of both dark matter and dark energy has long perplexed scientists, DST said, adding that if confirmed, this new approach of looking for particle decay signatures could provide vital clues into the composition of the predominant matter in the universe. “Upcoming precise measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation and high-redshift neutral hydrogen distributions may help corroborate the unstable cold dark matter hypothesis. More observations and theoretical advances will be needed to unravel the mysteries that lurk unseen throughout the cosmos,” DST said.","Scientists from Raman Research Institute in Bengaluru proposed a new approach to study cold dark matter (CDM), constituting 25% of the universe. By relaxing assumptions about weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) stability, they found WIMPs remain a viable CDM candidate, offering insights into the universe's composition.

Thus, technically speaking the imported device will be available in Indian market, within a few weeks, through unofficial channel. At $529, (Rs 24,330), the smartphone is cheaper than the Apple’s iPhone available at Rs 30,000. The iPhone 3G though not available as yet, will cost upwards of Rs 40,000, when its US price is converted in Indian rupees. “We hope to allow people in other countries to purchase the Nexus One and future phones from Google soon,” the Google spokesperson added. Nexus One is definitely a feature rich phone. It comes with a 5 megapixel auto focus with flash and 4GB SD card, which can be further be expanded to 32 GB. Nexus One also introduces a voice-enabled keyboard for all text fields. One can speak a text message, tweet, or update Facebook, or an email, via voice. It can also search Google, call contacts, or get driving directions by just speaking into the phone. Google terms its phone as a superphone. “The Nexus One belongs to the emerging class of devices, which we call ‘superphones,’ with the 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset making it as powerful as your laptop computer of three to four years ago,” said Andy Rubin , VP of engineering at Google. The company plans to bring more Android phones to the market, he added. US analysts expect Google’s mobile ad revenue of $75 million to grow 100% annually, because of better control over the Android and mobile search environment. “Google is now functioning more like a hardware OEM, although it calls itself a “merchant” . Because the Nexus One can be unlocked from any carrier, the GSM-based handset is likely to compete with the Apple iPhone,” says Malindi Davies of US-based SFG Fundamental Research.","Google's Nexus One smartphone is set to challenge Apple and Nokia in India with its lower price and advanced features. Priced at $529, it's more affordable than the iPhone, positioned to compete at Rs 24,330 compared to the iPhone's Rs 30,000. While currently available in the UK, Hong Kong, and Singapore, its Indian launch is delayed due to a gradual rollout strategy. The Nexus One introduces features like a 5-megapixel camera and a voice-enabled keyboard, part of Google's plan to expand its presence in the smartphone market.",Technology and Gadgets,2010-01-07 00:00:00

This, even before monsoon has set in. ""Soon after trees fell, there were power snags. But we didn't expect it to last for 24 hours. Some residents had power back-up. But for many, it was a dark Friday,"" JC Kamdaar, resident of Anand Nagar, told TOI. The plight of HBR Layout residents is no different -- they are facing unscheduled power cuts at least 10 times a day! Those who depend on power for their livelihood are the worst hit. 1x1 polls Dilip Kumar, a businessman from HBR Layout, said: ""Due to long power cuts, even my generators get affected. I don't know how I will run my construction company with no power back-up. There is no point complaining to the Bescom helpline, I know no action will be taken."" Equally affected are professionals who have opted for working from home. ""I work from my home computer. Due to fluctuating power, my work gets affected,"" said Sudhir SM, a techie who stays near Diary Circle.

Home away from home for Pak delegates,"CHANDIGARH: For the hundred-odd delegates from Pakistan who crossed over at Wagah on Tuesday to attend the World Punjabi Conference at Patiala, the country they have entered is no alien land. Though not its citizens, its contours and people are what they are used to living amidst. No wonder it has been a cathartic experience for them, crying, hugging, laughing, jotting down e-mail ids, discussing the upcoming December 5-11 East-West Punjab Games, exploring whether they can visit the houses their ancestors left behind locked, in the hope that they will come back and reclaim them, but haven''t for over half a century. But it is the sameness of ambience that has left the guests wonderstruck. Even the roadside puncture-wallah hangs the tyre atop the tree the same way he does in Pakistan; and the danda-wielding cop is as brusque as the one back home; If only the heart does not skip that beat â€” God! why does it happen every time â€” when anyone crosses the white strip painted across the black asphalt road at Wagah, you would never know you are now ""abroad"". ""Pakistan hi lagda ji, lagda hi nahi India aaye hain. I am near Ludhiana now, on my way to Patiala, but I feel as if I am travelling from Lahore to Islamabad,"" Dr Amjad Bhatti, a Lahori working at Islamic University, Islamabad, said.

"Day after tragedy in MP's Harda, 41 firecracker shops sealed in Jabalpur district","JABALPUR: The administration in Madhya Pradesh's Jabalpur district on Wednesday sealed 41 shops selling firecrackers for noncompliance with licence norms, a decision coming in the wake of the Harda tragedy, an official said. An explosion and subsequent blaze at a firecracker factory in MP's Harda district on Tuesday killed 11 people and injured more than 200 others. Jabalpur Collector Deepak Saxena and Superintendent of Police Aditya Pratap Singh on Wednesday inspected manufacturing units, warehouses and shops of firecrackers and explosive materials located in the district. The officials found 41 firecracker shops located in Kathunda area flouting licence conditions, the district administration said in a press release. Besides, the officials also found that these shops had not maintained records properly. After finding many shortcomings like lack of proper security measures, fire NOC and record keeping, the collector instructed that the firecrackers be sealed, the press note said. Collector Saxena said if the shopkeepers do not follow the licence conditions, then they will not be allowed to run the set-ups, stressing that norms should be followed in letter and spirit to avoid any untoward incident. The collector and SP inspected a factory manufacturing sparklers at Manegaon. This unit had no clearance from the Pollution Control Board, the press note said. The collector asked officials to submit a report on the factory, spread over six and a half acres, it said. There are 137 shops or godowns related to firecrackers and explosive substances in the district and all have licences, which are being thoroughly investigated, it said. Meanwhile, more than 100 people were still undergoing treatment at different hospitals in Madhya Pradesh while two persons were missing after the blast, officials said","In the aftermath of the tragic firecracker factory explosion in Harda district, Madhya Pradesh, the administration in Jabalpur district took decisive action by sealing 41 firecracker shops for non-compliance with licence norms.

Trinidad mourns India's final loss,"Even the good luck wish from his rival-turned-friend and contemporary genius Brian Lara was not enough to help Sachin Tendulkar conquer the cocky Australians.Even the good luck wish from his rival-turned-friend and contemporary genius Brian Lara was not enough to help Sachin Tendulkar conquer the cocky Australians.Lara, who had once been seen as challenger to Tendulkar for the unofficial best batsman title, has in recent years been the Indian star's confidant and friend.Having seen his own team's challenge at the World Cup come to an end in the first stage, Lara - like the hosts and many other cricket fans around the world - backed India to get the measure of the defending champions. ""I would love to see Sachin and the boys really put it across the Australians -- sort of give them a bit of humble pie before they come out to the Caribbean,"" Lara had said on the eve of the final. But that was not to be. If any thing, it was the Australians who stuck it up against the Indians with their intimidating brand of cricket in the final on Sunday.Once the Australians ran up a huge total, a pall of gloom descended across the island. And when the Indian maestro top edged for a simple catch falling once again to Glenn McGrath, it was not only the billion hearts back home in the subcontinent that sunk but a few thousands among the Indian diaspora here too. Cricket is the umbilical chord that connects the ethnic Indians here to their motherland. It might not be mere coincidence that India's all three Test wins in the last thirty years have come in Trinidad which the expatriate Indians have made it their home away from home. And it was also here that Tendulkar had registered his first century on the Caribbean soil last year.Little wonder then that the whole island had rooted for India against the awesome Aussies in the World Cup final on Sunday which was broadcast live. Temples and other places of worships were given a go-by, and pubs kept their bars open through Saturday night to Sunday morning. One businessman here promised to buy ten cases of beer to celebrate India's victory but as wickets fell one by one he emptied his glass in one gulp and quickly walked out. Senior citizens were sorrowful as they felt they might never live to see India reclaim cricket's coveted trophy. Some blamed the captain's decision to bowl first, some others blamed the bowlers. India's winning run in the lead up to the final had put the Trinidadians on a high and they had pinned their hopes on Tendulkar to lead India to victory against Australia.There was some consolation though when Tendulkar was named Man of the Tournament, but then, as the little genius himself said, an individual award can hardly make up for the team's title triumph.","Despite a heartfelt good luck wish from his rival-turned-friend Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar and India could not overcome the dominant Australians in the 2003 World Cup final. Lara, who had once been Tendulkar's competitor for the title of best batsman, expressed hope for India’s victory, but the Australians proved too strong. The defeat was a blow to millions of Indian fans, especially in Trinidad, where the Indian diaspora had deeply connected with the team's journey. Tendulkar's early dismissal by Glenn McGrath left the fans disheartened. Though Tendulkar was named Man of the Tournament, he acknowledged that individual accolades could not replace a team title.",Sports,2003-03-25 00:00:00
Parties reject EC order To pass Bill in Monsoon Session,"New Delhi, July 8 In a rare show of unanimity, the country’s political parties today united to prevent efforts to encroach on their legislative competence. They decided to introduce and pass a Bill in the Monsoon Session of Parliament to replace the recent Election Commission guidelines to check the criminalisation of politics and corruption in public life. Briefing newspersons about the three-hour meeting attended by representatives of 21 major national and regional political parties at Parliament House this morning, Union Law and Justice Minister K. Jana Krishnamurthi said the draft of the Bill would be given to the political parties by this weekend for their comments and suggestions. Another meeting of political parties would be held next week to ascertain their views on the draft bill, which would be introduced in the Monsoon Session of Parliament beginning July 15. It would be the government’s endeavour to get the Bill passed “as quickly as possible,” the Minister said. Mr Krishnamurthi said all political parties were unanimous in holding that while the Supreme Court directive of May 2 to check criminalisation of politics was laudable, it was within the domain of Parliament to enact laws and no other Constitutional authority could take over this job. “We do not want a confrontation with the Supreme Court. But, each Constitutional authority has its sphere of functioning and Parliament’s role is supreme when it comes to enactment of laws,” he added. The Minister said once Parliament enacts a law on curbing criminalisation of politics, the EC guidelines of June 28, issued following a Supreme Court directive of May 2 would be automatically bypassed. The Minister said the EC guidelines, making it mandatory for candidates to disclose their assets, educational qualifications and any criminal records, had not taken into account “practical ground realities” faced by to the contestants. This would make the filing of nomination papers a cumbersome process and the general view among political parties was that nomination forms should be as simple as possible. Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, who attended the meeting, took note of the observations made by the members and said the poll process should not be “complicated by impractical and unnecessary road blocks,” Mr Krishnamurthi said. On the setting up of a National Judicial Commission for the appointment, transfer and superintendence of Supreme Court and High Court judges, the government today asked all political parties to give their views in writing. Meanwhile, Law Ministry sources said another all-party meeting would be convened at the earliest to discuss and finalise the suggestions of the parties on the draft Bill and then a final shape would be given to it for introduction on July 15, the first day of the Monsoon Session. In view of the unanimity among the parties on the issue, the Bill is expected to sail through by a voice vote, they said. The sources said that political parties rejected in toto the suggestion of the Supreme Court that the candidates should declare their educational qualification. When asked whether the Bill was meant to nullify the directives of the Supreme Court, the Law Minister said “We appreciate the Supreme Court judgement. There is no scope for any type of confrontation between Parliament and the Supreme Court because each one is supreme in its own sphere. Even the Supreme Court has recognised that as far as the enactment of law is concerned, Parliament is supreme.” On the law to be enacted, he said “this will be in tune with the Supreme Court order, which has specified that the EC notification would operate till Parliament enacts a law. Once the law is enacted, the notification would become redundant.” “The Government will do its best to achieve the objective with which the Supreme Court approached the issue of curbing criminalisation of politics and making the electoral system more transparent,” he said. “The substantial increase in the literacy rate is reflected among the MPs too. In the first Lok Sabha, the percentage of non-matriculates was around 25 while in the present Lok Sabha, their number constituted a meagre 2.4 per cent,” he added.","In a rare display of unity, 21 major national and regional political parties in India joined forces to introduce a bill during the Monsoon Session of Parliament. The bill aims to replace recent Election Commission guidelines addressing criminalization of politics and corruption. The political parties expressed unanimity in asserting Parliament's supreme authority in enacting laws, emphasizing that it is not within the domain of any other Constitutional authority. The bill, expected to simplify the nomination process, will be presented for discussion in the upcoming session.",Politics,2002-07-09 00:00:00
Lucknow University annual exams: Answer copies to be digitally codified,"LUCKNOW: Lucknow University will be digitally codifying answer copies of the annual examination to be held on March 1. Moreover, this year when the flying squad swoops on its examination centres, it would come equipped with a camera. The decision has been taken because there have been incidents of mass copying in the past but no action could be taken for want of evidence. Despite being caught by the squad, centres would deny cheating took place. Some institutions would also allege that the flying squad intentionally maligned them due to some personal interest. ""At times, cheating material, mass copying and writing on tables at the examination centre are reported but during the investigation, due to lack of evidence, a centre could not be barred. That's when the recording would come handy,"" said LU vice-chancellor SP Singh. The flying squad will not only record examinations to be held in 39 centres but also the seating plan, admit cards and students' identity cards during the inspection. He said that any unfair means reported at the colleges made examination centre, will have 10% UG seats deducted as punishment.

"TG’s FDI inflows double to $3 bn, Cong. outperforms BRS","Telangana has received $3 billion worth Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the financial year 2024, which doubled the invest- ment that the state received in the previous financial year, trailing only to Gujarat. Industry experts attribute this success to the Congress government's business-friendly initia- tives and a policy-driven approach. Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy's strate- gic promotion of Telangana as a premier investment destination, notably during the World Economic Forum (WEF) summit in Davos in January this year, has played a pivotal role in attracting global investors. While Gujarat topped the country with the highest growth rate of 201 per cent, Telangana stood second at 109.7 per cent growth rate. In FY2023, Telangana attracted FDI of 1.3 billion dollars which has more than doubled to 3 billion dollars in FY2024, accord- ing to the data released by the Department for the Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). The Revanth Reddy gov- ernment followed a low- key approach despite attracting double the FDI over the previous BRS regime. Revanth Reddy's efforts to attract FDI have been characterised by a silent yet effective out- reach to investors owing to the model code of conduct (MCC) for Lok Sabha elec- tions. The Congress govern- ment did not indulge in too much publicity like the previous BRS regim but ensured that it did not overshadow the substan- tive work being done behind the scenes. Industry circles said the key to the government's success was Revanth Reddy's ambitious Hyderabad 3.0 vision, which focuses on develop- ing three clusters. Developing Hyderabad cluster within the Hyderabad Outer Ring Road (ORR), Semi Urban Cluster between the ORR and the Regional Ring Road (RRR) and Rural clus- ter in the surrounding areas beyond the Regional Ring Road. These clusters will help to encourage the establish- ment of industries, they said. This comprehensive development plan has made Telangana an appeal- ing prospect for diverse investment portfolios. The recent WEF summit in Davos proved to be a sig- nificant milestone for Telangana, with FDI deals nearly doubling as the state attracted investments worth over Rs 40,000 crore, the highest-ever, in the Davos summit held in January this year. This achievement came just weeks after the new gov- ernment took office on December 7, 2023, indicat- ing the effectiveness of its swift action and clear poli-","Telangana has recorded a significant achievement in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) with inflows amounting to $3 billion in the fiscal year 2024, marking a doubling of investments compared to the previous year. This surge positions Telangana as the second-highest recipient of FDI in India, trailing only Gujarat. Industry analysts credit this success to the business-friendly initiatives and policy-driven approach adopted by the Congress-led government under Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy. His proactive promotion of Telangana as a prime investment destination, notably highlighted during the World Economic Forum (WEF) summit in Davos earlier in the year, has been instrumental in attracting global investors. The state's strategic positioning and focused efforts to improve infrastructure, ease of doing business, and sector-specific incentives have bolstered investor confidence. Telangana's burgeoning sectors such as information technology, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing have particularly benefited from this influx of foreign capital. While Gujarat leads in total FDI inflows, Telangana's impressive growth rate underscores its emergence as a competitive economic hub in India. The momentum generated by these investments is expected to further propel the state's economic growth and development initiatives in the coming years.",Local News,2024-06-24 00:00:00

Johnny Depp officially axed from 'Pirates Of The Caribbean',"Actor Johnny Depp has been officially dropped from the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" film series. A Disney producer said Depp will stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow after 14 years at the helm so the movies can have a reboot. ""We want to bring in a new energy and vitality,"" Disney's production chief Sean Bailey told The Hollywood Reporter. ""I love the (Pirates) movies, but part of the reason Paul and Rhett are so interesting is that we want to give it a kick in the pants. And that's what I've tasked them with."" Disney has met with writing duo Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick to pen the script for a reboot following their success with the ""Deadpool"" superhero franchise, reports thesun.co.uk. Depp's last ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" in 2017, which was the lowest performing of the five films. In October, scriptwriter Stuart Beattie appeared to confirm the news of Johnny's exit on DailyMail TV and revealed they will be reworking the entire franchise. Speaking about his exit, Beattie said: ""I think he's had a great run. Obviously, he's made that character his own and it's become the character he's most famous for now. ""And kids all over the world love him as that character so I think it's been great for him, it's been great for us, so I'm just very, very happy about it."" He added: ""I think Jack Sparrow will be his legacy. It's the only character he's played five times, it's the character he dresses up in to visit children in hospitals, it's what he'll be remembered for. ""Before Jack Sparrow came along, (Depp) was considered this kind of quirky, independent actor that made these really cool little Tim Burton films but he was by no means a movie star and a lot of people thought we were crazy for casting him at the time. ""Because he wasn't a proven commodity; you know, a big movie star. And we were making a big movie and we were putting this quirky, independent actor in the middle of it and people thought we were crazy.""","Johnny Depp has been officially removed from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film series by Disney, ending his 14-year tenure as Captain Jack Sparrow.

He also visited Bangalore and Chennai for similar partnerships. ""The objective of my visit to India is to help build interactions between students in Saskatchewan and India. Such interactions are beneficial for Indian students because the learning that comes from exposure to another culture has a lifelong impact,"" said Lingard. ""In a world where geographic boundaries are losing relevance, it is important for us to provide Indian children with a global edge so that they feel comfortable and confident whichever country they go to. Students also learn to fine-tune their English. For many students who cannot afford international education, such programmes are ideal to learn about other countries,"" he added.

"Elimination of poverty, unity among communities will be real tribute to B.R. Ambedkar in Konaseema, says Pawan Kalyan","Jana Sena Party (JSP) president Pawan Kalyan on June 20 (Wednesday) said that elimination of poverty and fostering of unity among all communities will be the real tribute to B.R. Ambedkar in the Konaseema region. Addressing his first public meeting in the Konaseema region as part of his Varahi Yatra, Mr. Pawan Kalyan said, “Division on the lines of caste will further hamper development of the fertile region.” Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy did not initiate any measures to consult the local communities while proposing to rename the Konaseema district after Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. It was a deliberate attempt to create social tension and disrupt harmony among castes, the JSP chief alleged. “The local communities that opposed the renaming proposal should have been consulted and convinced on the State government’s idea to prevent riots and disputes,” said Mr. Pawan Kalyan, who asserted that the JSP was never against the renaming of the district. ‘I draw inspiration from Balayogi’ Referring to the days of former Lok Sabha Speaker G.M.C. Balayogi, he said, “Balayogi’s contribution to the development of the region is still visible. After his demise, the region’s development has been ignored.” “Even in 2023, the fishermen of the region are struggling to get access to safe drinking water and health infrastructure. I draw inspiration from Balayogi, and will strive for the development of the region if our party is voted to power in 2024,” Mr. Pawan Kalyan said. “The prosperity of Andhra Pradesh will be in jeopardy if the Godavari farmers are in despair. However, the JSP will always be with the Godavari farmers to fight for their cause,” said Mr. Pawan Kalyan, who claimed that he had no plans of “retiring from politics,” irrespective of the results in the 2024 elections.

"‘Just trust us,’ govt to SSA teachers","Nagaland Chief Secretary, Temjen Toy and Principal Secretary, School Education, Menukhol John today appealed the agitating NSSATA to discontinue their protest and resume their duties. Addressing a press conference on Friday, Toy appealed the teachers to remember their responsibilities to the children. “I had assured them personally and even through the media I assure them that their grievances are being looked into. We are being as fast as possible. Despite the agitation we are working. We request them to stand down their agitation and not hold our children’s future to ransom,” he said. “But if they still insist to go on agitation then we will have to take action as per the laid down procedures under existing laws. We as a government cannot compromise the future of our children,” the Chief Secretary added. Principal Secretary, Menukhol John meanwhile said that the government “understands their frustrations,” and assured that it is “actively considering all their demands.” John admitted that the release of the teachers’ salaries “have been a little erratic in the past.” He however assured that the government has tried its best to address this issue. “Just trust us,” he stated, urging teachers to continue their work while trusting the government to look into their demands. On the NSSATA’s demands for release of salaries with 7th ROP benefits, John stated that the department has agreed in principle to extend the said benefits to the teachers. “But there are still certain formalities to be followed,” he informed. Regarding demand for transfer of salaries from Plan to Non Plan, the Principal Secretary said that at present there is not much difference between the two. “It has been our stance, whether one is paid through plan or non plan, it does not make any difference. The only critical issue here is that the salary should be paid on time. We have to work out a mechanism to see they get their salaries released on time.” ‘No Magic Formula’ He however urged teachers to understand that this cannot be done overnight and that there is no “magic formula” to solve the problem, considering the state’s financial burdens. The Chief Secretary meanwhile added that “today the term plan and non plan does not exist in government. It is not for any association or group of government employees to tell the government to demand salary from this fund or that fund.” He said that in government, “things do not happen automatically, procedures have to be followed, clearances have to be obtained and then calculations have to be made. Which is why though we have agreed in principle, it is going to take time to implement.” The Principal Secretary expressed the difficulty to provide a time frame suggesting that time frames do not provide a lasting solution but only a “band-aid kind of solution.” Admitting that there is “trust deficit” between the teachers and the government, he said if “I give a time frame and I don’t keep my word, then the trust deficit continues.” The Chief Secretary meanwhile stated that “if there are shortcomings from the part of the government, we were the first to admit that ‘Yes we were wrong’.” “We will take corrective measures. But just because a certain section of government is demanding does not mean that all demands are justified. Even if they go on agitation, the stand of the government is not going to change. We have made our commitment, our commitment stands. It is only a matter of time; it is not that we are delaying. There are certain preparations that have to be made,” he added. Govt admits to shortcomings on appointment controversy On the controversy surrounding appointment of the NSSATA 2010 and 2013 batch, where teachers were appointed on regular basis according to the advertisement, John stated that the “miscommunication” came about because the advertisements and recruitment order were not issued by the Mission as it happens in most other departments. “But in this case, it was done by the department. They do have a point in saying that they were appointed on regular basis. But the funding continues to be from the Mission.” The Chief Secretary also admitted that there have been shortcomings on the part of the government because they were supposed to be appointed against the program. “But at that point of time, out of oversight or whatever reasons, the appointments that were given in the form of any regular appointment. Though the intent of the government was as per the program guidelines, the manner in which the appointments were made was not proper. So now we are struggling to find out a solution to this,” he said. NSSATA to continue protest Meanwhile, on the third day of their third phase agitation, the NSSATA 2010 and 2013 batch shifted their venue to the Secretariat on Friday. Teachers sat on the road towards the Secretariat complex with placards. Despite the heavy security, the protest continued to be peaceful. Members informed that the agitation will continue on Monday outside the Secretariat until the government provides a written assurance under a specific time frame.","The Chief Secretary and Principal Secretary of Nagaland appealed to the Nagaland SSA Teachers' Association (NSSATA) to end their protest and resume duties, citing ongoing efforts to address their grievances. The NSSATA has been demanding the release of salaries with 7th ROP benefits and the transfer of salaries from Plan to Non-Plan. The government officials assured that the demands were being actively considered but urged trust in the government's process. The officials acknowledged miscommunication regarding the appointments of NSSATA members and expressed commitment to finding a solution. Despite the appeal, NSSATA members continued their protest at the Secretariat, stating it would persist until the government provides a written assurance within a specific timeframe.",Education,2018-06-08 00:00:00

Oil prices tumble near $60 as gas supplies surge,"NEW YORK: Oil prices neared $60 per barrel Wednesday as the U.S. government reported unused gasoline held in storage surged yet again. Energy markets are undergoing an extended sell-off, the longest in 10 months, with new economic reports dampening optimism about any economic recovery. Benchmark crude for August delivery fell more than 4 percent, or $2.79, to settle at $60.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In just over one week, oil prices have fallen more than 18 percent. ``The recession is far from over, said analyst Stephen Schork. ``Perhaps the run-up in prices was a bit overstated. Crude prices by last week had more than doubled from lows reached January, when a barrel of crude cost just over $30. That was just six months removed from record highs near $150 per barrel last summer. Cheap oil sparked a new round of investment, as did a dollar that had been weakened by government efforts to bail out major banks and automakers. Crude is priced in the dollar, so it effectively becomes cheaper internationally. Yet dismal economic data continues to emerge and the fundamentals of supply and demand appeared to take control of the market again last week. Since peaking at $73.38 last Tuesday, crude futures have fallen by almost $13 per barrel. Gasoline, heating oil and natural gas futures are also tanking. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries predicted Wednesday that demand for crude has fallen so sharply, it will take another four years to recover to 2008 levels. Americans are driving billions fewer miles than they had in recent years with millions losing their jobs. Even though refiners have been slashing production, gasoline continues to pile up. The Department of Energy reported Wednesday that gasoline supplies grew by another 1.9 million barrels last week, the fifth straight week that storage levels have grown. Federal regulators said Tuesday they would examine whether the government should impose limits on the number of futures contracts in oil and other energy commodities held by speculative traders. Concerns about the affect of volatile energy prices has spread overseas as well. It will be one of the topics discussed by world leaders meeting in Italy for the Group of Eight summit. In an editorial published by The Wall Street Journal, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy also called for closer government oversight of the oil-trading markets In other Nymex trading, gasoline for August delivery slid by 9.9 cents to settle at $1.6333 a gallon and heating oil lost about 6.2 cents to $1.5386. Natural gas for August delivery fell 6.7 cents to $3.362 per 1,000 cubic feet. In London, Brent prices shed $2.02 to $61.21 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.","Oil prices approached $60 per barrel as the U.S. government reported a surge in unused gasoline held in storage, contributing to an extended sell-off in energy markets.

"Dalai Lama asserts right to find successor, China fumes","The Dalai Lama said on Wednesday that the 600-year-old institution of spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhists will continue after his death and a trust created by him will be the sole authority to recognise his reincarnation, effectively shutting out any role for China in choosing his successor. Speculation has swirled about the future of the institution since the Nobel laureate head of Tibetan Buddhism said in 2011 that he would decide on his 90th birthday – which falls on July 6 this year – whether the position should continue.His Wednesday announcement, which clarifies matters, came at a Tibetan religious conference in McLeodganj, near Dharamshala, that is part of a week of celebrations to mark his birthday. The Dalai Lama outlined the process for choosing his successor in a pre-recorded video message and said his decision was influenced by numerous requests from Tibetan spiritual leaders, members of the Tibetan Parliament-in-exile, and the Buddhist diaspora in the Himalayas, Mongolia, the Russian Federation and Asia, including mainland China, that the institution should continue. “In particular, I have received messages through various channels from Tibetans in Tibet making the same appeal. In accordance with all these requests, I am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,” he said, drawing cheers from more than 100 monks who gathered along with long-time supporters such as Hollywood star Richard Gere and journalists from across the world in a McLeodganj library. “I hereby reiterate the Gaden Phodrang Trust has sole authority to recognise the future reincarnation; no one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,” the Dalai Lama said, referring to a non-profit he founded in 2015 that oversees matters related to the spiritual leader and the institute of the Dalai Lama. The remarks ruled out any role for China in recognising his reincarnation. Hours later, an irate Beijing, which describes the Dalai Lama as a “separatist”, countered that the spiritual leader’s reincarnation “must be approved by the central (Chinese) government”. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news briefing, “The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama and other great Buddhist figures must be chosen by drawing lots from a golden urn, and approved by the central government.” “The Chinese government implements a policy of freedom of religious belief, but there are regulations on religious affairs and methods for managing the reincarnation of Tibetan living Buddhas,” she added. The Communist Party of China has insisted that Chinese authorities will anoint the next Dalai Lama by pulling a name from a “golden urn”. The Chinese side claims this has been the way of choosing the successors of Tibetan Buddhist leaders since the 18th century, but this method has been dismissed outright by the Dalai Lama and his millions of followers. Over the years, the Dalai Lama has said the institution could be wound up, or that his successor could be a woman or someone born outside Tibet. He has also said it was possible there might be no successor at all. Many observers believe there eventually will be rival Dalai Lamas — one appointed by Beijing, and one by senior monks loyal to the current Dalai Lama. Born Lhamo Thondup, the leader became the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1940. He fled Tibet at 23 when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959 and has been living in Dharamshala since 1960, helping establish a democratic government-in-exile while also travelling the world to advocate autonomy for the Tibetan people. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China. On Wednesday, the Dalai Lama recalled his remarks in 2011 about consulting the high Lamas of Tibetan Buddhism and the Tibetan public when he turned 90 to decide whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue. Acknowledging that there were “no public discussions on this issue” over the past 14 years, he said leaders of Tibet’s spiritual traditions, members of the Tibetan Parliament-in-exile and the Central Tibetan Administration, non-governmental organisations, and the Buddhist diaspora in the Himalayan region, Mongolia, Buddhist republics of the Russian Federation and in Asia, “including mainland China”, had written to him “earnestly requesting that the institution of the Dalai Lama continue”. He told the conference, being attended by representatives of all major Tibetan Buddhist traditions, that the process for recognising his reincarnation was clearly established in his statement of September 24, 2011, which said this responsibility “will rest exclusively with members of the Gaden Phodrang Trust”. Members of the trust should consult heads of Tibetan Buddhist traditions and “reliable oath-bound Dharma Protectors” linked to the lineage of Dalai Lamas. “They should accordingly carry out the procedures of search and recognition in accordance with past tradition,” he said. The spiritual leader was recognised as the 14th Dalai Lama at the age of two and renamed Tenzin Gyatso. Tibetan officials have said the process of recognising reincarnations of lamas in Tibetan Buddhism is strictly a Tibetan religious tradition, with no role for outsiders. Penpa Tsering, the president of the government-in-exile, said Tibetans from around the world made “an earnest request with single-minded devotion” that the position of the Dalai Lama should continue “for the benefit of all sentient beings in general and Buddhist in particular.”“In response to this overwhelming supplication, His Holiness has shown infinite compassion and finally agreed to accept our appeal on this special occasion of his 90th birthday,” he said at a press conference. Tsering, however, warned China not to meddle in the process of the Dalai Lama’s succession, saying it is a “unique Tibetan Buddhist tradition.” The search for a Dalai Lama’s reincarnation begins only upon the incumbent’s death. In the past, the successor has been identified by senior monastic disciples, based on spiritual signs and visions, and it can take several years.","On his 90th birthday, the Dalai Lama confirmed that the 600-year-old institution of the Dalai Lama will continue after his death. He declared that the **Gaden Phodrang Trust**, which he established in 2015, will be the **sole authority** to recognize his reincarnation—excluding any role for **China**, which has claimed it must approve the successor through its own historical procedures, like drawing lots from a “golden urn.” The Dalai Lama made the announcement during a religious conference in McLeodganj, following appeals from Tibetan leaders, spiritual figures, and diaspora communities across Asia, including from within Tibet. He emphasized that the **traditional Tibetan process**—involving spiritual signs, consultations with senior monks, and guidance from Dharma Protectors—will guide the selection. China swiftly objected, reaffirming its claim to control the reincarnation process. Observers now anticipate the possibility of **rival Dalai Lamas**: one appointed by Beijing and another by Tibetan religious leaders. The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was recognized at age two and has lived in exile in Dharamshala since 1960, advocating for Tibetan autonomy and spiritual freedom.",International News,2025-07-03 00:00:00

""There is a slight possibility of cold-day on Sunday, with the minimum temperature likely to drop below 10 degrees. But if that happens, it will be just for one day, as the maximum temperatures will rise slightly from January 24 onwards after rain activities subside. However, from Monday, the minimum temperature will drop by 3 to 4 degrees for the next three to four days,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Skymet. He added that an active western disturbance led to the rain in the capital. Delhi recorded 4.9 mm rainfall at Safdarjung, the city's base weather station, till Saturday evening. This took the total January rainfall to 68.5 mm this year, which is the highest in the month since 1995. ""Weather may clear up by Monday,"" added Palawat.

"Rakhis, Vrindavan-themed masks for ‘Modi bhaiya’ from widows","Widows living in various ashrams of Vrindavan are eagerly looking forward to sending rakhi and Vrindavan-themed masks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to mark the festival of Raksha Bandhan this year. Till last year, some widows from Vrindavan used to visit the prime minister’s residence in Delhi to tie rakhi to him on Raksha Bandhan. But this year they will not meet the prime minister due to COVID-19 pandemic. Though the widows would miss the opportunity of meeting Modi during this Raksha Bandhan , they have prepared 501 special rakhis with images of Modi and a similar quantity of special Vrindavan-themed face masks which are being sent to him. These rakhis containing colourful photos of Modi have been prepared by a group of aged widows living in Maa Sharda and Meera Sagabhagini ashrams. With the aim to break the social stigma, well known social reformer and founder of Sulabh Movement, Dr Bindeshwar Pathak, had started organising all important Hindu rituals for widows living in Vrindavan . Raksha Bandhan is among them but no such programme is possible this time due to COVID-19 crisis. “The ongoing coronavirus crisis disheartened these widows but it didn’t shatter their spirit so they started preparing rakhis and special Vrindavan-themed masks for Modi.

Security concerns delay FM-III rollout,"NEW DELHI: The much awaited rollout of the third phase of FM radio is likely get further delayed with the defence ministry raising some security issues pertaining to ‘‘sensitivities'' of the rollout in the border areas.FM-III is expected to throw up about 800 new radio stations in small towns with a special focus on border areas of J&K and Northeast. The proposal has been pending before the Union Cabinet for some time now. According to I&B ministry sources the defence ministry has made certain suggestions about the rollout. ‘‘There are certain issues raised by the defence ministry. We hope these will be taken up in a meeting with the Cabinet Secretariat soon,'' a ministry source said. While maintaining that it was ‘‘fully supportive'' of the new policy, the defence ministry (MoD) said it had only suggested ‘‘some steps'' which should be taken into consideration for the FM transmitters. For one thing, MoD wants that the frequency distribution should be allocated in consultation with it since the armed forces also use different types of communication equipment in the border areas. ‘‘The working of their equipment should not be disturbed,'' said an official. For another, the ‘‘content or programme development'' should also take ‘‘inputs'' from the armed forces because of ‘‘their large-scale involvement'' in the forward areas. ‘‘The Army, for instance, has been running ‘‘Operation Sadbhavana'' in J&K — an initiative that aims to help rebuild the socio-economic life of people hit by terrorism. Such initiatives should also be reflected in the programmes, which should not be merely restricted to Bollywood songs,'' he added. MoD has also rejected the proposal that armed forces should provide security to the transmitters and stations. ‘‘Armed forces do not provide security to static civilian installations. For such duties, there are other forces like CISF,'' he said. The I&B ministry has been keen on pushing the policy and has even incentivised the entry of private channels by cutting down infrastructure costs by 50%.","The rollout of FM radio's third phase in India, aiming to bring stations to underserved areas including border regions, is facing delays due to security concerns raised by the Defense Ministry. The Issue: The Defense Ministry is concerned about potential interference with military communication equipment in border areas like J&K and the Northeast. Defense Ministry's Suggestions: They propose joint frequency allocation with the ministry to avoid disruption. Content development should consider military initiatives like ""Operation Sadbhavana"" to better serve border communities. Security for radio stations should be handled by civilian forces, not the military.

How online pharmacies have landed in a regulatory limbo,"The rise of the digital economy has led to a fast-paced change in the business landscape which the policy can't keep pace with. India's online pharmacy sector, which has seen a rapid spread in the past few years, is now hanging in a regulatory limbo. The promise of immediate scaling up in the digital business has led to a spawning of online pharmacies in India. But aggressive sales models and lack of clarity on regulation have jeopardised their future. The budding sector now runs the risk of getting banned. Online pharmacies not only provide easy access to common medicine but also to critical illness medicines which are not available all the time and everywhere with offline chemists. When most of the commerce is going digital, medicine too will be sold online. But online sale of medicine has raised several concerns, especially in the absence of any regulation specifically for them. India’s online pharmacy segment is backed by some of the world’s top investors, including Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital, Temasek and Prosus, in addition to having large conglomerates such as Reliance Industries and Tata group investing in companies such as NetMeds and 1mg. The Covid-19 pandemic triggered a consolidation in the sector and saw the entry of large players such as Reliance Industries and the Tata Group, which picked up Netmeds and 1mg, respectively. Amazon, Flipkart and Apollo are other big names in this sector which has close to a dozen large pharmacies. Early this year, Reliance Retail made a foray into standalone pharmacy stores under its subsidiary, Netmeds. Less than two years ago, two big online pharmacies, Tata owned 1mg and its rival PharmEasy, had planned to go offline to have an omni-channel presence to widen their user base. The concern around online pharmacies A chemists' organization has written to the Cabinet Secretary, urging him to intervene and ban online pharmacies for violating norms and putting people's lives at risk. Online pharmacies are accused of predatory pricing, compromising data privacy, unrestrained and irrational use of prescription drugs, and unlicensed sale of drugs. Early this month, medicine retailers and distributors in Delhi urged the state government to issue an order restraining online, and many offline, pharmacies from offering discounts. They claimed that these pharmacies advertise heavy discounts ranging from 10% to 80%. The practice of heavy discounting is ""unethical"" and may lead to influx of substandard and spurious medicines, ""which in turn can play havoc with the lives of the patients"", they said. Online pharmacies have been accused of providing easy access to narcotic drugs, pregnancy termination kits, antibiotics and sedatives. Another concern is that a large number of children use the Internet and they could be victims of wrong medications. Many online pharmacies collect area-wise data related to the consumption of medicines which increases the risks involved with patient safety. However, the main issue is the sale of medicine by online pharmacies without license. Is a ban in the offing? The chemists demand a ban on online pharmacies for selling drugs without license. But existing drug laws do not mention online pharmacies so they cannot be licensed or regulated under them. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued the draft amendment to the Rules, 1945, for inclusion of the rules to regulate online sale of drugs vide its August 28, 2018 notification and had called for objections and suggestions from all stakeholders. But a chemists body challenged the ministry's notification, claiming that the draft rules were being pushed through in serious violation of the law, ignoring the health hazards caused due to sale of medicines online without proper regulations. In December 2018, the Delhi High Court, in an interim order, had stayed the sale of drugs without licence by online pharmacies while hearing the chemists body's PIL. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) in February this year issued show-cause notices to 20 e-pharmacies, including Tata 1mg, Amazon, Flipkart, NetMeds, MediBuddy, Practo, and Apollo, over the online sale of drugs in alleged violation of norms. The notice stated that the DCGI had forwarded the order to all state and Union Territories in May and November 2019 and again on February 3, 2023, for necessary action and compliance. The regulator said the online platforms were doing the business in contravention of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. The Delhi High Court recently granted six weeks to the Centre to inform it about the outcome of consultations and deliberations with stakeholders on draft rules to regulate e-pharmacies. The court made it clear that the pendency of the present matters will not come in the way of the Union of India in taking action against the persons who are violating the interim order dated December 12, 2018. The government is preparing a new law to replace the existing drug regulations. The New Drugs, Medical Devices and Cosmetics Bill, 2023, which seeks to replace the existing Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940, is expected to have stringent norms for online pharmacies. The revised draft, which has been sent for inter-ministerial consultation, states, ""The central government may regulate, restrict or prohibit the sale or distribution of any drug by online mode, by notification."" A group of ministers had earlier stated that they were in favour of banning online pharmacies. What online pharmacies say Online pharmacies have claimed that despite multiple communications being sent by their representatives seeking audience with the health ministry on this issue, there has been no response. Industry sources told ET in March that there is an impasse between the government and industry on several matters. ""The government has done its own analysis of the sector and its business model, and companies are looking to have conversations,” the sources said. Industry executives said health ministry officials had met select executives of some of the top e-pharmacies prior to issuing show cause notices. In written representations to the government sent following the show-cause notices, online pharmacies argued that the notices served by the DCGI to companies was “a cause for anxiety” for the industry. “The retail pharmacy sector needs a lot of supply chain, technology and access solutions to make healthcare delivery more efficient and affordable, and a prerequisite for this is a simple and clear regulatory pathway for innovation to thrive in this important space,” a Ficci communication read. “The recent show-cause notice may cause regulatory uncertainty at ground level in several states. Hence, there is a need for direct engagement/dialogue between sectoral players and relevant government stakeholders to avert any further state-level market disruptions,” it added. A few days ago, API Holdings, the parent of PharmEasy, sought the Union Health Minister’s intervention for quick notification of the draft rules to remove regulatory uncertainty regarding their existence after the DCGI issued show cause notices. ""We seek your support towards the quick notification of the draft e-pharmacy rules and the New Drugs, Medical Devices and Cosmetics Bill 2022 to remove any uncertainty and to harmonise all the existing regulations under which the epharmacy is already compliant,"" the letter said. In March this year, a parliamentary committee urged the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to notify the draft epharmacy rules. It said it was “appalled” that the rules had not been finalised till date. The committee, headed by Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi, said while tabling the report on ‘Promotion and Regulation of E-Commerce in India' that undue delay in adopting a definitive regulatory framework results in uncertainty, which is not conducive for the fast-paced digital markets. It recommended that the draft e-pharmacy rules be finalised and implemented without further delay","The digital economy's rapid growth has spurred the rise of India's online pharmacy sector, but it now faces regulatory uncertainty. Online pharmacies provide convenient access to medications, yet concerns about predatory pricing, data privacy, and unlicensed sales have arisen. The government has issued draft rules to regulate online drug sales, but legal challenges and debates persist. Chemists' organizations have called for a ban on online pharmacies, citing violations of existing drug laws. However, online pharmacy advocates argue for clear regulatory pathways to support innovation and efficient healthcare delivery. The government is considering new legislation to replace outdated drug regulations, aiming to address concerns and establish stringent norms for online pharmacies. Despite industry efforts to engage with the government, an impasse remains, highlighting the need for transparent dialogue to resolve regulatory uncertainties and ensure safe and accessible online pharmaceutical services.",Health and Wellness,2023-05-29 00:00:00

Slow poison: 80% of New Delhi’s tap water has plastic toxins,"More than 80% of New Delhi’s tap water is contaminated by plastic microfibres, new research has shown. This is the third highest contamination rate in the world after the US (New York and Washington DC) and Beirut, Lebanon. These findings are part of a study conducted after testing 150 samples of tap water collected by news website Orb Media from five continents. Though many in Delhi’s well-off circles do not use tap water for drinking, large swathes of the capital’s population have no access to safe drinking water. Research found the US had the highest contamination at 94%. Plastic fibres were found in samples taken from various sites, including the Congress buildings and Trump Tower in New York. Beirut was marginally behind at 93% followed by India at 82%. European nations, including UK, Germany and France, had the lowest contamination rate of 72%. These microscopic fragments enter the water system in several ways, from synthetic fibre clothing, tyre dust and microbeads. Most of these are believed to originate from clothes, upholstery and carpets. Washing machines and dryers add to the problem. According to a Guardian report, a UK study found that each cycle of a washing machine could release more than 700,000 microscopic plastic particles. Scientists suspect plastic can leach toxins once inside the human body. Sherri Ann Mason, an expert on plastic pollution at the State University of New York in Freedonia, who supervised Orb’s study, said: ``We have enough data from looking at wildlife and the impact that it's having on wildlife to be concerned. If it's impacting them, then how do we think it's not going to somehow impact us?” Commenting on the extent of pollution, Mason told TOI that the findings had surprised her. “Study after study has indicated the contamination of every compartment of our environment. As plastic is so prominent in the world's water in general, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised to find it in our drinking or tap water, but I thought with our filtration methods the particles would be removed.” About 300 million tons of plastic is produced annually in the world. While scientists have focused their attention on oceans and rivers, studying plastic pollution's impact on marine life, seabirds and the human food chain, the effect of microplastic's presence in the human body has still not been researched enough. The latest study shows that both developed and developing economies appear to be battling with the problem. Mason said, ``I expected that developed nations would show less contamination than developing, but it was quite the opposite. I really think this is simply owing to the prominence of plastic pollution within the environment. As plastic is a ubiquitous contaminant we can't expect to be able to filter ourselves out of this problem.’’","A study conducted by Orb Media has found that over 80% of tap water in New Delhi is contaminated with plastic microfibers, the third-highest contamination rate globally.

Kerala launches mobile app to find how many rural children attend school,"Android-based app will form the core of a village-level survey Preparing village education register on children’s education in the State is no easy task. What will make the job of the enumerators easier is a mobile app developed by the management information system (MIS) team of the Samagra Shiksha, Kerala. After the Right to Education Act (RTE) came into effect, it was mandatory to collect details of all children of school-going age in a place to ensure that those in the 6 to 14 age group were getting free and universal education, Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, project director A.P. Kuttykrishnan said. Rather than collect details of children studying in schools, the register preparation would involve gathering particulars of children of school-going age in all households. The survey would help bring all children to schools, making Kerala the first State to ensure this. Follow-ups on their education status too would become easier, Samagra officials said. The Android-based app, whose name was yet to be finalised, would form the core of the door-to-door enumeration process, though a website too had been developed as an alternative, they said. Over one crore households would be surveyed. While a large part of the survey would be done using the app, the offline format would be used in areas where a stable Internet connection was difficult to come by. Keeping in mind the enormity of the task, Samagra Shiksha’s MIS team developed the app that would display pre-fed data, courtesy integration of panchayats’ datebase into the app. This would ensure that not every bit of information would be have to be filled in. Only if there were children in a would fields such as student’s name, gender, UID number, date of birth, school, class, management, and reasons for remaining out of school become visible for filling in, they said. “The information will help determine if a child is going to school or not. The register has to be updated every year,” Mr. Kuttykrishnan said. Enumerators, including Samagra Shiksha teachers, people from the Local Self-government Department, and National Service Scheme students, would spend over 20 minutes in each house collecting details. Officials said focus would be on children with special needs, migrant children, and those living in tribal areas where the number of out-of-school children and dropouts were found to be higher. While attempts had been made in the past to survey the number of dropouts and out-of-school children at the local level, the results were not satisfactory. The campaign-mode survey would be an accurate record of the number of children in school, they said. A trial would be held this month in Aynicode ward of Porur panchayat in Malappuram district to figure out any challenges in undertaking the survey and how to overcome these, Mr. Kuttykrishnan said. The survey is expected to be completed by the end of the year.","The Samagra Shiksha project in Kerala is undertaking a village-level survey to prepare a comprehensive education register for children. This initiative is mandated by the Right to Education Act to ensure free and universal education for children aged 6 to 14. To facilitate this, an Android-based mobile app, developed by the MIS team, will streamline the door-to-door enumeration process. This app integrates with panchayat databases to pre-fill information and will collect details such as student names, gender, UID number, date of birth, school details, and reasons for non-attendance. The survey aims to enroll all school-age children and track their educational status annually. Enumerators, including teachers and volunteers, will conduct the survey, focusing on children with special needs, migrants, and those in tribal areas. A trial will be conducted in Malappuram district to address potential challenges before the full-scale survey is completed by year-end.",Science and Technology,2019-08-21 00:00:00

"March quarter will be robust for us: Yogen Lal, COO, Unity Infra","Whatis the revenue conversion timeline of current projects on hand and how many projects are you L1 bidder in? Current visibility from our order book is for around 28 to 30 months. In terms of value, we would have an L1 position in approximately 360 to 400 crores of projects. ould you walk us through how many projects are you running cost or time overruns on? Most of our projects are running on time. Only because of this rigorous monsoon that we had recently - in the north and the west, particularly - it was accentuated. There might be a slight time overrun but that will be made up in this working season. What kind of penalties do you have ifthese projects are not finished? Are there heavy penalties for not completing on time and ifthatis the case and how do these guys get away by leaving highways on for 10-10, 20-20 years? There are liquidated damages to the tune of 5% of the contract value generally across contracts. But those are for reasons which are attributable to the contractor or the construction entity which is undertaking that project. Since you have spoken about the road project in general, there are so many instances of land acquisition deals. For instance, we are doing a project in Mumbai, JVLR where the last 1 kilometre is still encroached and that has not been removed for the last probably 4 or 5 years. So in such cases, the contractor has very little to do because this is, after all, the responsibility of the government. In the next 1 or 2 quarters, which of your significant projects are nearing completion or you expect a bigger payment coming through because that projectis either getting completed or perhaps it may be in the next year March quarter or June quarter? Traditionally, the fourth quarter of the fiscal is the strongest for any construction company because this is the commencement of the working season. We expect that around 5-6 projects will be completed in the next 5-6 months. So we do expect that the March quarter will be quite robust for the company as it has historically been.","The company anticipates a revenue conversion timeline of 28 to 30 months, with an L1 position in projects worth 360 to 400 crores.

Spain makes face masks mandatory in hospitals and clinics after a spike in respiratory illnesses,"Face masks will be mandatory in hospitals and healthcare centres in Spain starting on Wednesday due to a surge in respiratory illnesses, the Health Ministry said. The new leftist minority coalition government is imposing the measure despite opposition from most of Spain’s 17 autonomous regions. “We are talking about putting on a mask when you enter a health centre and taking it off when you leave,” Health Minister Mónica García told Cadena Ser radio late Monday. “I don’t think it is any drama. It is a basic and simple measure of the first order,” she added.Spain’s hospitals have come under immense pressure in recent weeks following a spike in cases of flu,COVID-19and other respiratory illnesses. García’s ministry decided to impose the measure after failing to reach an agreement with regional health authorities, many of whom argued that mask use should be recommended but not obligatory. Regional governments are in charge of healthcare although the central government can intervene if it deems it necessary. Six regions have already introduced the measure and masks have been commonly used on streets and public transport and in health centres in recent months. Spain declared a formal end to the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic last July, saying people no longer needed to wear masks in health and care centres and pharmacies. Over the previous two years, Spain had gradually ended mandatory mask wearing, first in public and then on public transport. The country registered more than 14 million cases and some 120,000 deaths from thecoronavirus.","Starting Wednesday, all people visiting hospitals or healthcare centers in Spain will have to wear face masks due to a rise in respiratory illnesses despite resistance from most regions. Health Minister Mónica García emphasized the measure as vital and non-dramatic for everyone's safety amidst an increase in cases of flu, COVID-19 and other similar diseases that are stressing hospits over recent weeks. This directive is enforced by a central government after unsuccessful attempts to reach consensus with regional health authorities advocating voluntary mask use instead of mandatory compliance. Some regions have already adopted the measure while Spain had earlier declared an end to COVID-19 crisis in July 2023, stating that no longer required individuals to wear masks inside hospitals and pharmacies as well as on public transportation after two years since its outbreak peaked with over 14 million cases.",International News,2024-01-09 00:00:00

Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw informed the house on Thursday that the railways spent Rs 98.10 to earn Rs 100 in 2022-23. Vaishnaw's answer came in response to a question raised by Jawhar Sircar, Rajya Sabha MP from the All India Trinamool Congress party, who asked, ""Whether the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has declared that finances of the Indian Railways have slipped into 'concern zone' in 2021-22."" Sircar asked the minister to provide a year-wise operating ratio of Railways over the last five years and whether Railways spent Rs 107 to earn Rs 100 in 2021-22. ""Whether it is a fact that if accounting adjustments like considering advances for next financial year as receipts are ignored, the ratio has stayed above 100 per cent since 2018-19,"" the Rajya Sabha MP also asked. In response, Vaishnaw stated that CAG in its report 13 of 2023 examined railways finances to the end of March 2022 and submitted its recommendations. ""Railway operations continued to be adversely impacted by the disruption induced by Covid-19 in 2021-22 also. Despite this Railways' achieved total receipts of 1,91,367 cr. against 1,40,783 cr. in 2020-21 i.e. incremental revenues of 50,584 cr,"" he said.

The five-year data, provided by the minister, shows that the Railways spent Rs 97.30 in 2018-19, Rs 98.36 in 2019-2020, and Rs 97.45 in 2020-2021 to earn RS.100","Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw informed the Rajya Sabha that post-Covid-19, Indian Railways achieved its highest-ever total revenue of INR 2,40,177 crore in the fiscal year 2022-23, with an operating ratio of 98.10%.

All court orders can now be challenged,"The new amendments to Code of Criminal Procedure -- that have been kept in abeyance for almost a year -- have also laid down procedures for the protection of rape victims seeking punishment for their tormentors. The code gives victims the right to appeal against a court order acquitting an accused, or convicting the accused of a lesser offence. Under the amended Section 372 of CrPC, the victim will not need the permission of any law enforcement or prosecuting agency to appeal a court order. Currently, an appeal can be made only if the prosecution so decides -- a lacuna which allows the rich and the powerful who can influence the prosecution to get away, literally, with murder.","The new amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), pending implementation for nearly a year, establish procedures to protect rape victims seeking justice. Under the amended Section 372, victims can appeal court orders acquitting the accused or convicting them of lesser offenses without needing permission from law enforcement or prosecuting agencies. This change addresses a significant gap in the current system, which allows appeals only if the prosecution decides to do so.

RBI: Banks to continue accepting scribbled notes,"Mumbai, December 31 Banks will continue to accept currency notes with scribbling, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said today, dismissing rumours that it has stopped banks from accepting such notes from tomorrow. “In the wake of rumours circulating in the market that from January 1, 2014, banks will not accept banknotes with anything written on them, the RBI has urged members of public not to fall prey to such rumours and to use their banknotes without any fear,” the RBI said.

"Viru, Unmukt give Delhi good lead","Virender Sehwag is just a shadow of his past self now. The spectacles seem to have disturbed the famous hand-eye coordination he once was known for. The uninhibited swing of the bat and his disdain for the ball is still there to admire but the timing ditches him. His 64-run knock on Monday was full of mistimed shots but the ones that did connect evoked memories of the past. It wasn’t a flawless innings as the bowlers troubled Sehwag throughout his 90-ball stay in the middle. That there was ample assistance for the bowlers from the pitch and the weather made it an important innings for Delhi, who are looking to take maximum points from the game. Sehwag’s third wicket partnership of 128 runs with Unmukt Chand, who is unbeaten on 87, earned the hosts a crucial 60-run lead in the first innings as Delhi posted 201 for 3 on the second day of their Ranji Trophy match against Rajasthan at the Ferozeshah Kotla Stadium. For the second consecutive day, poor light robbed the day’s game of a good number of overs — 38 on Monday — as the morning session was completely lost to the fog. Upon resumption, Delhi lost night-watchman Varun Sood in the sixth over of the day with the addition of just 12 runs. It brought Sehwag and Unmukt together and they batted for the next 30 overs with a mix of caution and aggression. Initially, Sehwag looked a bit tentative, throwing his bat at every other ball and fishing outside the off-stump. A few edges flew past slips too but after spending a few overs at the crease, his batting started to look more and more compact and the shots that were betraying him at the start began to flow smoothly. Habits die hard, as they say, and Sehwag isn’t one to let anyone dictate the terms. living up to his name, he completed his half-century with a six over the bowler’s head. Amidst all this, Unmukt quietly built his innings playing second fiddle to his senior partner. In fact, Sehwag’s presence at the other end helped the former India U-19 captain. Sehwag’s aggression, as it used to do for his Indian team partners, eased the pressure on Unmukt. To his credit, Unmukt also batted well and never seemed bothered by the movement of the ball. Sehwag’s innings finally came to an end when he tried to pull a short-pitched delivery over mid-wicket. His departure didn’t affect the scoring rate as Mithun Manhas immediately took over the role of the aggressor and briskly scored 34 runs. As weather is expected to be foggy for the next couple of days, Delhi look to play the morning session on Tuesday and put Rajasthan in once again and try to earn maximum points from the match. Brief Scores Rajasthan: 141 (Rajesh Bishnoi 57, Aristh Singhvi 28; Parvinder Awana 2-15) trail Delhi: 201/3 in 56 overs (Unmukt Chand 87 batting, Virender Sehwag 64, Mithun Manhas 34 batting; Aniket Choudhary 2/23) by 60 runs.","Virender Sehwag's Ranji Trophy performance has been a mix of mistimed shots and glimpses of his past brilliance. Sehwag, who is now playing for Delhi, scored 64 runs in their match against Rajasthan, with a third-wicket partnership of 128 runs with Unmukt Chand. Despite his less-than-perfect innings, the partnership helped Delhi post a total of 201 for 3 on the second day, earning a crucial 60-run lead in the first innings.

Consider plea against converting parking area into park: HC,"Madurai: Madras high court has directed the authorities to consider and pass orders on a plea seeking a direction to the executive officer of Kanyakumari special grade town panchayat to stop the proceedings to convert a two-wheeler parking area on the western side of Triangular Park, opposite Gandhi Mandapam, into a park. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Manikandan. The petitioner's counsel submitted that the parking area itself is insufficient, and converting it into a park would cause huge traffic congestion in the area. A representation by the petitioner was also not considered. A division bench of justice M S Ramesh and justice A D Maria Clete observed that it is needless to point out that whenever a representation of this nature is made to a statutory authority, there is a duty cast upon them to consider the same on its own merits and pass appropriate orders in one way or another, instead of keeping it pending indefinitely. Non-consideration of the representation by the statutory authority would amount to dereliction of duty. The court will be justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Article 226 of the Constitution and directing them to consider the same within a stipulated time. Hence, the judges directed the authorities to consider and pass orders on merits and in accordance with the law on the representation made by the petitioner within three months, after giving sufficient opportunity to all parties concerned. The petition was disposed of.","The Madras High Court has directed the authorities to review and pass a decision on a petition requesting the halt of converting a two-wheeler parking area near Triangular Park in Kanyakumari into a park.

Ajay Devgn's high-octane action stunts in Tezz,"Ajay Devgn has done some thrilling action sequences in his upcoming release Tezz The promos of Priyadarshan’s slick thriller Tezz have created quite a buzz. Ajay Devgn and the rest of the cast have performed high-octane action stunts designed by Hollywood power duo Gareth Milne (Bourne Ultimatum and Bourne Identity) and Peter Pedrero (stunt co-ordinator of The Bourne Supremacy and a few action sequences from the Harry Potter series).The film also stars Anil Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Sameera Reddy and Zayed Khan, and has been produced by Ratan Jain. Says Devgn, “It’s a fabulous mix of international action and Indian emotions. Films work only if they connect with the audience, and Tezz has that emotional element. It has been presented in a very stylised manner with some fabulous action.” Peter Pedrero who has previously worked in some Indian films says, “Ajay has done a lot of his own stunts and was very focused. He is a very good student; when we demonstrated something, he would listen carefully and then within a couple of attempts perfect the shot. One day we were doing some test shots on a jet ski at very high speeds and close to the riverbank. Priyan asked me, ‘Do you think we could get Ajay to do something like that?’ Just as I was about to answer him, we looked over at the man doing the tests and did a double take. Who we thought was a stunt driver actually turned out to be Ajay!” Among the many thrilling action sequences in the film, Ajay and Anil have shot a hand-to-hand combat sequence in a tunnel. “Both actors are fantastic. We briefed them in detail about how trained their characters would be and then designed the fight around their capabilities. We wanted them to do all the fights themselves and not use body doubles, making it look more dramatic and believable,” Pedrero informs. The action director also says that the car, bike and helicopter chase sequences involving Devgn are very explosive. “We shot on busy streets in Birmingham and in Scotland. I would say the hardest and possibly the most dangerous stunt is when Sameera’s character slides her bike underneath a parked truck and safely emerges on the other side. All the action involving the vehicles was challenging.” Tezz is a Venus Worldwide Entertainment presentation and releases on April 27.","In the upcoming film ""Tezz,"" Ajay Devgn showcases thrilling action stunts crafted by Hollywood experts Gareth Milne and Peter Pedrero.

women pose for nude photo shoot to protest Donald Trump,"Web Desk People have always found new and ingenious ways to protest against something or someone they see as wrong but posing nude for a photo shoot to protest against US presidential candidate and Republican hopeful Donald Trump by over 100 women is surely going to amuse and at the same time shock you. This photo shoot has been organised by an eminent photographer Spencer Tunic in which a 130 women took part. These women volunteered to be a part of Spencer’s project and posed with mirror in their hands while nude for the photo shoot. The stated aim of this project was to syncretise politics and art in order to send the message that Donald Trump is unfit for the White House. It must also be noted that Tunic is famous for organising Nude photo shoots of this kind even though this is the first time he ever organised such a photo shoot to send a political message because it was necessary to do so according to Spencer. According to Spencer, just voting against in the upcoming US presidential elections isn’t enough. “I have a wife and two kids. I can’t believe that a leader from the Republican Party would such a language against women and minorities”, Tunic said. Tunic also said that he had to do something to voice his dissent against such a myopic and imbecilic mindset. Photographer Spencer Tunic also called Donald Trump a looser. The photos of 100 women that took part in Spencer’s initiative will be released shortly before the US presidential polls on 8th November this year. Tunic choose a private property in Cleveland, Ohio for the photo shoot to avoid police interference because of the nudity laws in the state. He also chose Cleveland because a Republican Party convention is scheduled to take place here on Monday, 18th of July.

"First US lunar lander since 1972 launched: The mission, significance","A spacecraft developed by a private US company and carrying a bunch of scientific instruments from NASA,took off from Florida on Monday (January 8), hoping to become the first US spacecraft to land on the Moon in more than 50 years. The Peregrine lander module of the mission, as well as the Vulcan rocket that launched it, have both been built by private space companies in the US. The Mission is part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative that seeks to involve private space sector in its ambitious Artemis programme that is planning a return to the Moon in a big way. If successful, this mission would also involve the first landing of a private spacecraft on the Moon. Last year, a Japanese company had attempted a moon landing with its Hakuto-R mission but was unsuccessful. In 2019, the first Israeli attempt to land on the Moon was also engineered by a private company, but the spacecraft, Beresheet, had crash-landed. The first U.S. commercial robotic launch to the Moon successfully lifted off Jan. 8 on the first flight of@ULALaunch’s#VulcanRocket.@Astrobotic’s Peregrine Mission 1 lander is expected to reach the lunar surface in February:https://t.co/csvx73ZqgPpic.twitter.com/N7Mxiqi8GC — NASA (@NASA)January 8, 2024 However, hours after the launch, the spacecraft developed technical problems that could be potentially fatal. Astrobotic Technology, the Pittsburgh-based aerospace company that built the spacecraft, said the problem was preventing it from attaining a “stable Sun-pointing orientation”. That could hamper the spacecraft’s solar power batteries from charging efficiently and could derail the entire mission. The company said it was trying to rectify the problem. The mission Five payloads from NASA sat inside the Peregrine lander that was launched by the Vulcan heavy rocket on Monday. The lander has been built by Astrobotic while the rocket came from United Launch Alliance, another private enterprise. The spacecraft will take more than 40 days to reach the Moon, and is planned to make a landing on February 23. The payloads are meant to carry out various exploratory activities, including detection of water. One of the payloads, called Laser Retroreflector Array, is a collection of several mirrors that would allow precision measurements of the distance of other orbiting or landing spacecraft by reflecting light from them. This particular instrument would remain permanently deployed on the Moon’s surface, and would act as a marker for distances on the Moon. The other payloads would remain active for ten days after landing. Return to Moon No US spacecraft has landed on the Moon since Apollo 17 in December 1972. That was the last of the six Apollo missions to have made the moon-landing, each allowing two astronauts to walk on the Moon’s surface. The United States reignited its interest in the Moon in the 1990s but started almost afresh, sending a few Orbiters to study the lunar surface and environment from a distance. It was only in 2018 that the US decided to make a return to the Moon, this time for longer stays. Over the next few years, the Artemis programme plans to send a series of Moon missions, including those carrying astronauts. The first Artemis mission was sent off in November 22. It orbited the Moon and returned to the Earth. NASA is planning to send the first crewed mission into space next year, and would attempt a human landing on Moon in 2025. The Artemis programme seeks to establish a permanent base camp on the Moon, and send astronauts and robots for longer stays for more comprehensive exploration, and scientific studies, of the lunar surface and atmosphere. It would also explore opportunities for the utilisation of resources available on the Moon with the ultimate objective of launching deep space missions from the lunar surface. Collaboration with private sector For the Artemis programme, NASA has sought cooperation from the private space industry as well through this Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative. As of now, at least 14 private companies have been contracted to carry NASA payloads to the Moon, according to information on the NASA website. This collaboration is aimed at creating the market and technology ecosystem in the private space industry with respect to science and technology needs of lunar exploration. Monday’s launch was the first under the CLPS initiative. “We are so excited to see this vision become a reality. CLPS is an innovative way of leverating American companies to send important science and technology payloads to the Moon,” Nicola Fox, associate administrator of Science Mission Directorate at NASA was quoted as saying in a statement. NASA administrator Bill Nelson called it a giant leap for humanity. “The first CLPS launch has sent payloads on their way to the Moon – a giant leap for humanity as we prepare to return to the lunar surface for the first time in over half a century. These high-risk missions will not only conduct new science on the Moon, but they are supporting a growing commercial space economy while showing the strength of American technology and innovation. We have so much science to learn through the CLPS missions that will help us better understand the evolution of our solar system and shape the future of human exploration for the Artemis generation,” Nelson was quoted as saying.","A private US company successfully launched NASA's Peregrine lander into space aboard United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket, aiming to become the first privately-built lunar landing vehicle in over five decades (since Apollo 17). The mission is part of NASA's Artemis programme and represents a significant effort under its Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative. If successful after more than forty days, Peregrine will land on the Moon to carry scientific payloads for various studies, including water detection using mirror-based instruments intended as permanent lunar markers. Technical issues arose shortly post-launch; however, Astrobotic Technology is working to resolve them before landing scheduled on February 23rd. The mission marks a step towards establishing US presence back on the Moon and fostering collaboration between NASA and private sector companies for space exploration (NASA).",Science and Technology,2024-01-09 00:00:00

Bird-hit Lankans bowled out for 294,"Australia’s four-pronged pace attack overcame spirited resistance from Lahiru Thirimanne and Mahela Jayawardene before dismissing Sri Lanka for 294 to bring an end to the opening day of the third Test on Thursday. Both Thirimanne, who scored a career best 91 just three days after joining the squad as an emergency replacement, and Jayawardene, who hit 72 in his penultimate innings as captain, threatened to make the day their own. Ultimately though, Australia captain Michael Clarke’s decision on winning the toss to send his pacemen out to bowl first was all but vindicated and the hosts will have finished the day confident they can wrap up the series 3-0. Jackson Bird, the least experienced of the pace quartet, took 4-41, Mitchell Starc 3-71 and Peter Siddle grabbed a brace with spinner Nathan Lyon pitching in to end Thirimanne’s knock just shy of his maiden Test century. Brought in for his first Test since last April to replace the injured Kumar Sangakkara, Thirimanne had shown a fight that had largely been absent from the batting of his better-known compatriots on the tour. The lefthander survived an lbw decision on his first ball courtesy of the television appeal and assumed the mantle from Jayawardene when his captain was dismissed after his first half century outside Sri Lanka for more than three years. Thirimanne reached his second Test half century with a cover drive off Mitchell Johnson for three runs and, punishing any loose deliveries, smashed 13 fours and a six in his 151-ball knock. The end to his innings came chasing another boundary off Lyon and it took an exceptional catch from David Warner at cover point to snare the miscued drive, leaving the batsmen bowed over his bat in despair. Injuries had forced Jayawardene into making four changes to the side that was thrashed by an innings and 201 runs in Melbourne last week and he seemed determined to make up for that humiliation, on his own if necessary. After a cautious start with his team on 26-1, the 35-year-old came out firing after lunch and smashed 13 boundaries in his 154-minute knock before Starc removed him with a fizzing ball that caught a thick edge and flew to Clarke in the slips. There was a nervous wait for the raucous crowd basking in the sun at the Sydney Cricket Ground while a check was made for the no ball, but the television pictures confirmed that Starc’s heel had grazed the white line. “Today Mahela batted really well under pressure,” said Thirimanne. “I think I saw Mahela play one of the best knocks in Test cricket.” Starc, rested for the Melbourne Test, also accounted for captain-elect Angelo Mathews (15) and returned to remove Dinesh Chandimal. — Reuters SCOREBOARD Sri Lanka 1st innings Karunaratne c Hussey b Bird 5 Dilshan c Wade b Bird 34 Jayawardene c Clarke b Starc 72 Thirimanne c Warner b Lyon 91 Samaraweera lbw b Siddle 12 Mathews c Hussey b Starc 15 Chandimal b Starc 24 Prasad c Starc b Siddle 2 Herath c Siddle b Bird 5 Lakmal c Hussey b Bird 5 Pradeep not out 17 Extras: (lb 8, w 3, nb 1) 12 Total: (all out; 87.4 overs) 294 Fall of wickets: 1-26, 2-72, 3-134, 4-167, 5-222, 6-250, 7-256, 8-271, 9-273 Bowling: Starc 19-0-71-3, Bird 19.4-10-41-4, Siddle 15-3-46-2, Johnson 13-1-58-0, Lyon 19-2-69-1, Hussey 2-1-1-0","Australia's bowlers dismissed Sri Lanka for 294 on the first day of the third Test, despite resilient innings from Lahiru Thirimanne and Mahela Jayawardene.

"BJP, BRS to celebrate merger of erstwhile Hyderabad princely state on Sunday","Poll-bound Telangana will witness hectic activity here on Sunday, especially over the commemoration of the merger of this erstwhile princely state with the Indian union 75 years ago, with the BJP, ruling BRS and AIMIM having lined up events to mark the day. The Congress, fancying its chances of another electoral win in the south, is likely to sound the poll bugle with its announcement of ‘guarantees’, in a bid to repeat a winning strategy in neighbouring Karnataka earlier this year. Meanwhile, the Congress is holding its Working Committee (CWC) meeting today and an extended session on Sunday in the city. Union Home Minister Amit Shah would attend ‘Hyderabad Liberation Day’ event, organised by the Central government to mark the merger of this erstwhile princely state on September 17, 1948. The event is scheduled to be held at the Parade Grounds in the city. Shah had attended the celebrations last year as well which was organised officially by the Centre for the first time. Separately, ruling BRS founder and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao will be participating in the “National Integration Day,” organised by the state government to mark the merger. The Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM would organise a ‘Tiranga bike rally’ followed by a public meeting on Sunday to commemorate “National Integration Day”. September 17 is interpreted differently by different parties in Telangana. The BJP celebrates the day as “Telangana Liberation Day”, to commemorate the region’s freedom from the then Nizam rule. The saffron party has been fighting for its official celebration by the governments for over two decades now. It has been critical of the incumbent BRS government for not organising an official function despite being in favour of it during the Telangana statehood agitation. The CPI has been conducting week-long celebrations of “Telangana armed struggle,” contending that the movement spearheaded by the Communists led to the merger of the Nizam’s Hyderabad State with the Indian Union. The party would organise a public meeting at Tukkuguda on city outskirts on Sunday evening where it would announce its ‘guarantees’ for the coming Assembly polls in Telangana, which comes months ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The party, which registered an emphatic win in the Karnataka elections in May, had earlier promised five ‘guarantees’ including monthly assistance to women, free bus travel for them and unemployment dole.","Poll-bound Political activity is taking place in Telangana as different parties celebrate the 75th anniversary of the state's union with India. While the current BRS administration observes ""National Integration Day,"" the BJP celebrates it as ""Telangana Liberation Day."" While the CPI, following their successful tactic in Karnataka, focuses on the ""Telangana armed struggle"" and makes ""guarantees"" for the impending Assembly elections, AIMIM organises a bike protest and public meeting.

(Virat Kohli warns Australia: There are certain lines which shouldn't be crossed)Smith and partner Peter Handscomb were then caught looking towards the area outside Australia's dressing room, where television replays can be seen, while discussing whether to review the verdict, prompting umpire Nigel Llong to intervene.

But Kohli pointed out that the Australians have done that previously in the Bengaluru Test. (Bengaluru Test: Ashwin's 6/41 seals sensational victory for India)The incident has left a bad taste in the mouth at the end of an absorbing Test match. While Sourav Ganguly, in an exclusive interview with Aaj Tak, asked for action to be taken against the Aussie captain, Michael Clarke told India Today it was unacceptable if Australia were indeed seeking help from outside the field for DRS. ""From my perspective, when I was playing I remember having a brain fade when I gloved a ball and did not walk off. So I don't want to be too judgemental on anybody. If what Virat is saying is true and Australia are using their support staff to help them with DRS then that's not on, it is completely unacceptable,"" Clarke told India Today. ""I think Smith respects the game and if it's a one-off, then it's a brain fade. ""If you look at the footage, Peter Handscomb actually suggested Smith to turn around and look to the support staff. If this was a one-off, I don't think that would have happened. The fact that Handscomb is even thought of asking the Australian skipper to turn around and look to the support staff, I've got my concerns,"" Clarke said.","Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has said that it was unacceptable if Australia were seeking help from outside the field for the DRS.

Become self - reliant : Yogi to mayors,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday met six newly-elected mayors at his official residence and directed them to make their respective municipal corporations 'self-reliant' in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Atma Nirbhar Bharat. The chief minister also instructed all the mayors to promote a positive image of the municipal corporations, from boosting the income of the municipal corporations to resolving local issues with the support of public representatives. The chief minister also advised all the mayors to do “something good” and “something new” and gave them the necessary suggestions. He also asked them to be active and alert in solving regional problems. He asked the mayors to give priority to the work of underground cabling, as well as solid waste management and liquid waste management. In addition, guidelines were issued to address the persistent issue of stray dogs in urban areas. During the meeting, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asked the mayors to concentrate on increasing the income of municipal corporations and making them self-reliant. He advised them on exploring additional sources of income, particularly through the improvement of municipal taxation. He said that facilities should be made available to citizens so they could conveniently deposit their taxes. The chief minister instructed the mayors to maintain regular communication and foster coordination with public representatives. Expressing concern over illegal taxi stands, the chief minister said that action should be taken to remove illegal taxi stands in urban areas.

Washington Prepares Sanctions Against Maldives for Banning Israeli Passport Holders,"In a significant geopolitical development, Washington is preparing to impose sanctions on the Maldives in response to its decision to ban Israeli passport holders. The Maldivian government’s move, which it justifies as a stance against Israel’s military actions in Gaza, has drawn sharp criticism from U.S. lawmakers. The Maldives, renowned for its luxury resorts and idyllic beaches, announced its intention to amend national entry laws to prevent Israeli passport holders from entering the country. The decision of Maldivian President Dr Mohammed Muizzu, linked to alleged war crimes associated with Israel’s operations in Gaza, has sparked outrage among U.S. politicians who see it as a discriminatory act. Leading the charge against the Maldives is Representative Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ). Known for his staunch support of Israel, Gottheimer is drafting the Protecting Allied Travel Here (PATH) Act, which aims to cut off U.S. assistance to the Maldives unless it rescinds the travel ban. “Taxpayer dollars shouldn’t be sent to a foreign nation that has banned all Israeli citizens from traveling to their country,” Gottheimer stated. He further condemned the Maldives’ actions as “a blatant act of Jew hatred,” emphasizing the strong alliance between the United States and Israel. The PATH Act would condition U.S. aid to the Maldives on the country’s relaxation of its travel restrictions against Israeli citizens. This legislative move is seen as a form of sanctions that could significantly impact the Maldives, a Muslim-majority nation heavily reliant on international aid and tourism. The Maldivian government, however, remains steadfast in its position. It frames the travel ban as an act of solidarity with the Palestinian people. This is not the first time the Maldives has taken such a stance; in December, it imposed a docking ban on Israeli ships, further straining relations. The unfolding situation underscores the complex dynamics of international relations and the balancing act nations perform in their foreign policies. The Maldives’ actions reflect its alignment with Palestinian causes, while the U.S. response highlights its commitment to defending Israel against perceived injustices. As this legislative battle progresses, the outcome will have significant implications for U.S.-Maldivian relations and could set a precedent for how the U.S. handles similar situations in the future. For now, the Maldives stands firm in its decision, while Washington gears up to leverage its legislative power to enforce a reversal.","In response to the Maldives' decision to ban Israeli passport holders, citing solidarity with Palestinians against Israeli military actions, U.S. lawmakers, led by Representative Josh Gottheimer, are preparing the Protecting Allied Travel Here (PATH) Act. This legislation aims to cut off U.S. aid to the Maldives unless it rescinds the ban. Gottheimer condemns the ban as ""Jew hatred,"" emphasizing U.S.-Israel ties. The Maldives defends its stance despite potential U.S. sanctions, having previously banned Israeli ships. This standoff reflects global geopolitical complexities and underscores U.S. support for Israel amidst international criticism. The outcome will significantly impact U.S.-Maldivian relations and set a precedent for future U.S.",International News,2024-06-09 00:00:00

SC: Use of violence not an essential condition to invoke provisions of MCOCA,"The Supreme Court has observed that the actual use of violence is not an essential condition to invoke provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). A bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Aniruddha Bose said: “Actual use of violence is not always a sine qua non for an activity falling within the mischief of organised crime, when undertaken by an individual singly or jointly as part of organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate.” The bench added that threat of violence or even intimidation or even coercion would fall within the mischief, and this apart, use of other unlawful means would also fall within the same mischief. The bench noted that clause (e) of Section 2(1) of MCOCA makes it clear that ‘organised crime’ means any unlawful activity by an individual singly or jointly, either as a member of organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate, by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means. The bench said the suggestions on behalf of the appellant to limit the activity only to the use of violence is obviously incorrect when it omits to mention the wide-ranging activities contemplated by clause (e) of Section 2(1) of MCOCA, i.e., threat or violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means. The top court made these observations while hearing an appeal challenging the Bombay High Court order, Nagpur bench, which declined to entertain a plea by one Abhishek against invocation of MCOCA against him. Abhishek and others were accused in the alleged kidnapping of a restaurant owner in Nagpur in May 2020. They had sought Rs 20 lakh as ransom. Abhishek argued that the authorities erred in interpreting the provisions of the special enactment. The police charged the accused under MCOCA as he has been named in multiple such cases of violence. The top court noted that strict adherence by the authorities to the MCOCA requirements cannot be stretched beyond common sense and practical requirements in terms of the letter and spirit of the statute. It emphasized that the rule of strict construction of a penal statute cannot be applied in an unviable manner, which renders the statute itself nugatory. However, the top court did not accept the appellant’s contention that to attract Section 2(1) (e) which deals with organised crime, use of violence is essential. The bench noted that all cases against the appellant, either pending or disposed of, involved offences against human body and property, rioting and use of deadly weapons. “The submissions on behalf of the appellant for consideration of his case because of application of stringent provisions impinging his fundamental rights does not take away the impact of the blameworthy conduct of the appellant,” noted the bench. Dismissing the appeal, the top court said all the contentions urged on behalf of the appellant remain baseless and challenge herein ought to fail.","The Supreme Court clarified that the actual use of violence is not always necessary to invoke provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). The bench stated that organized crime activity under MCOCA encompasses not only the use of violence but also threats, intimidation, coercion, or other unlawful means. This decision came during a case involving an appeal by an individual named Abhishek, charged under MCOCA for an alleged kidnapping in Nagpur. Abhishek argued that the authorities misinterpreted the MCOCA provisions and claimed that the stringent provisions infringed upon his fundamental rights. However, the court maintained that the appellant's contentions lacked merit and his appeal was dismissed, highlighting that the stringent nature of the law does not nullify the individual's culpable behavior. The court emphasized that a strict interpretation of penal statutes should align with the statute's intended purpose.",Crime and Justice,2022-05-23 00:00:00

"The biggest tech trends to watch out for in 2021, from Fintech to E-Commerce","Technology to the Internet of Things, from the Internet of Things to the Cloud to the Smart Home, your shopping cart needs to change, according to a new report from KGI Securities. In a ""Smart Home"" report released Tuesday, KGI revealed that a number of its top selling product names and services, such as Home Shopping Cart, App Store, and even a subscription to KGI Online also had their growth spurt in the second quarter due to the launch of their products. On a list of top 20 ""Fintech"" services that KGI said they used to be the fastest growing, ""Visa, Bancorp, Visa, and MasterCard are on note but have now lost out or are on the precipice of a loss,"" KGI's report states. KGI also showed a sharp rise in a year-to-date year-end number of revenue, which resulted in $6.3 billion in revenue growth in 2016, a 20 percent increase over the year-ago peak. KGI's report goes on to highlight other promising new services, which it highlighted earlier this year, including a new ""Smart Home"" service for the first time in four years that will feature a home entertainment system built into the device. ""Fintech has its own way"" at the top of the list, KGI report says, and now it will ""continue expanding its customer base of IoT in the form of its 'Smart Home' initiative,"" adding that ""the overall U.S. economy has been built more on a personal experience, with more business investment than on a digital product."" The report said that the U.S. economy grew by nearly 4 percent between 2001 and 2015, with the exception of that year, when gross domestic product contracted, and the consumer spending, which is now growing, grew over the same period. If KGI's report wasn't bad enough, it appears that other major tech firms and emerging technologies have also recently taken notice of KGI's report. Google Inc.'s $18.2 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter was an important shift in Google's business, according to the company's quarterly results released in February on its website. The company added a record $38.1 billion in revenue that year, to $4.9 billion. In terms of the largest annual increase, Google added $27.7 billion in the quarter, up from $22.5 billion a decade ago. Alphabet's growth slowed at the expense of rival Microsoft Corp., but gained 8 percent year-over-year in the same period to $13.3 billion. According to KGI's report the company's digital products are one of the top topics of discussion around the company. The report also notes that in 2016, KGI had a total of 27 new digital products, including three new devices (including the upcoming wearable smartwatch, which is about 20 percent better than the current version of the Watch) which will include Google Apps and new software. The new device features a new, curved screen, improved video playback and an improved battery life, while the $4-dozen units are compatible with Android 9.0+ software, the KGI report notes. KGI's report also highlighted several other tech companies, including Apple Inc.'s iPhone, with a $4 billion growth in revenue, and Microsoft's HoloLens, currently at $1 billion, added 6 percent growth over 2012. ""Smart Home"" technology may have a chance to lead the way in the coming months based on KGI's reports, even if KGI fails to make an impact in the industry. Microsoft has been in the process of relaunching its cloud services for Windows 10, while others are also looking to start moving their business around. KGI's report also highlighted the significant growth in the number of new services that Microsoft is offering as part of its $15 billion partnership with Nokia to provide customers with enhanced Nokia voice call functionality that is now available to Windows 10 and Windows Phone 8.1 handsets. Among the options now available to users, Windows 10 Mobile, is ""a premium, unlimited, multi-year device upgrade of a mobile device without a dedicated Windows Mobile user experience"", according to KGI. However, KGI report says that KGI's own report about ""smart home"" doesn't go out to any specific company's customers and that there's a real disconnect between the market's overall perception and KGI's current performance. The report notes a number of areas that should allow KGI to grow its business in 2020 in order to move in the right direction. With its latest report out, KGI said it has already taken on some of the leading companies in its industry into the future of the smart home and the future of its business.

Nokia handset output crosses 500 m,"Mobile phone maker Nokia has said that its state-of-the-art facility at Sriperumbudur near here has crossed the 500-million mark in handset production. This is, perhaps, the fastest production ramp-up that Nokia has seen in any of its ten facilities across the globe. The 500th million phone, a Nokia C3-00, will be autographed by brand ambassador Shahrukh Khan and auctioned. The proceeds of the auction will go to a charity. Nokia has also decided to gift all its employees a Nokia C3-00 handset as a gesture of appreciation for contributing towards achieving this milestone. Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Prakash Katama, Director, Chennai Factory Operations, Nokia India, said the Finland-based company had invested around $285 million and carried out two expansions in the Indian facility. Since it was set up in 2006, the facility had grown to become the largest mobile phone making unit in the world, he said. The Nokia Telecom SEZ (Special Economic Zone) today housed five component suppliers, he said. Mr. Katama said there was lot of room for increasing the local content of the handset made from Sriperumbudur. Currently, the local content was around 20-30 per cent, he said. The handsets made in India went to over 100 countries across six continents, he added.

CJI: N’tl judicial database says 63L cases delayed due to non-availability of counsels,"Over 63 lakh cases across the country have been considered to be delayed due to non-availability of counsel and over 14 lakh cases are delayed as they await some kind of document or record, Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud said on Friday here. Speaking at the inauguration of the Andhra Pradesh Judicial Academy, Justice Chandrachud said people must get rid of the colonial mindset of referring to and treating the district courts as subordinate judiciary in hierarchy and in practice. They are not only the backbone of the judiciary but also the first interaction with the judicial institution for many. Bail, but not jail, is one of the most fundamental rules of the criminal justice system, he said. Yet, in practice, the number of under-trials languishing in prisons in India reflects a paradoxical situation, the CJI pointed out, adding that deprivation of liberty, even for a single day, is a day too many. ""Across the country according to the NJDG (National Judicial Data Grid) data, almost 14 lakh cases have been delayed as some kind of record or document is being awaited which is beyond the control of the court,"" he said. ""Similarly, across the country over 63 lakh cases have been considered to be delayed, as per NJDG data due to non-availability of counsel. We really need the support of the Bar to ensure that our courts are functioning at optimum capacity,"" the CJI said. He, however, said it may be much higher or lesser as more data is yet to be received from all courts. Speaking about district courts, he asserted that Section 438 of the CrPC (bail) and Section 439 (cancellation of bail) must not be meaningless, mechanical, procedural remedies which are perceived at the grassroots level, at the district judiciary, only to get a rejection and then move to a higher court. According to him, remedies must be provided by the district judiciary itself as they affect the poorest of the country. Justice Chandrachud said there is also a brooding sense of fear among the courts of the first instance, on how the grant of anticipatory bail or a normal bail will be perceived at the higher level and that fear is not purely irrational. ""There have been multiple cases where trial court judges have been pulled up for grant of bail in certain High Courts. The performance of judges has been analysed on the basis of their conviction rate. At the chief justices conference, I have specifically called upon the chief justices to ensure that such practices are done away with,"" he said. The CJI said as part of the 'Digital India' mission, common service centres are being set up all over the country down to the level of every Gram Panchayat and the Supreme Court is trying to ensure that the e-court services are merged so that judicial facilities are availed at the village level in the country. ""Our mission has to be to ensure that the whole colonial model of people seeking justice is replaced by a new justice delivery system where we reach out to our citizens,"" he said adding that providing certified copies online is just one step in the process. The Chief Justice said women legal professionals have outnumbered men coming into the judicial fraternity.","Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud highlighted delays in over 63 lakh cases due to counsel unavailability and 14 lakh cases awaiting documents. He emphasized the significance of district courts, advocating meaningful application of bail provisions at grassroots levels. Chandrachud criticized the fear among trial courts regarding bail decisions' scrutiny by higher courts. He discussed the transition towards digital justice delivery, aiming for accessibility at village levels. Chandrachud noted the increasing presence of women in the legal profession.

The nine cities chosen in the fourth round are -Bareilly, Moradabad and Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh, Erode in Tamil Nadu, Bihar Sharif in Bihar, Silvasa in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Diu in Daman and Diu, Kavarati in Lakshadweep and Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh. Shillong will be the 100th city provided it submit its proposal to the Centre in next three months, a senior official said. The nine cities were selected from 15 cities that had submitted their proposals to the ministry, the official said. Uttar Pradesh's Meerut, Ghaziabad, Rampur and Rae Bareli were among cities that failed to make the cut for Smart City tag. Silvasa topped the list of winners in this round. ""The nine cities selected have proposed an investment of Rs 12,824 crore... which would be impacting 35.3 lakh persons living in these areas,"" Puri told a press conference here. He said these cities have proposed to take up various project, including ""smart"" roads, rejuvenation of water bodies, cycle tracks, walking paths, smart classrooms, skill development centres, upgradation of health facilities and pan city projects like integrated command control centre. These cities have proposed 409 projects which would get around 61 per cent funding from the Centre and the state, Puri said. In January 2016, 20 cities were announced under the Smart Cities mission, followed by 13 cities in May 2016, 27 cities in September 2016 and 30 cities in June 2017. The total proposed investment in the 99 Smart City Mission would be Rs 2.03 lakh crore. Puri said Kolkata's New Town, which was selected for the mission in May 2016, was yet to form a special purpose vehicle to start implementing the projects. The West Bengal government, however, has already announced that it would not participate in the Centre's Smart Cities Mission. Puri said the Smart Cities Mission is setting a new benchmark in terms of project implementation. 'Smart City Centers', based on advanced technologies, have become operational in four cities - Pune, Surat, Vadodara and Kakinada and work is in progress in 18 more cities. As on January 17, Puri said there were 2,948 projects worth Rs 1.38 lakh crore in various stages of implementation, while 189 projects worth Rs 2,237 crore have been completed. Here is a list of 9 new smart cities: 1. Silvassa 2. Erode 3. Diu 4. Biharsharif 5. Bareilly 6. Itanagar 7. Moradabad 8. Saharanpur 9.

"Truck drivers protest: Chandigarh caps petrol, diesel sale as stir hits fuel supply; details here","The Chandigarh administration imposed restrictions on the sale of petrol and diesel as the strike by some truckers' associations entered the second day on Tuesday. The decision came as people queued up at fuel stations at many places in Punjab on Tuesday over fears that stocks would run dry soon. In view of the nationwide strike, Chandigarh has imposed a limit on the sale of petrol and diesel. Effective immediately, two-wheelers in Chandigarh are now allowed to buy only 2 litres or a maximum value of ₹ 200 of fuel, while four-wheelers are limited to 5 litres or a maximum value of ₹ 500. A press release issued by the Chandigarh administration said, “In light of ongoing strike by drivers of fuel-tankers and restricted supply of Petrol & Diesel in UT Chandigarh, District Magistrate Chandigarh by orders has imposed temporary restriction on Petrol/Diesel sale at fuel stations in Chandigarh."" The district magistrate emphasised that this measure is a “precautionary step to manage the current situation until normalcy is restored”. It added that efforts are going on to resume the supply of fuel to Chandigarh in coordination with oil marketing companies and the authorities of Punjab and Haryana. “The imposed limitations are a proactive measure to ensure the availability of fuel for all during this period of temporary disruption of fuel supply. Fuel station operators are urged to comply with these regulations, and consumers are kindly requested to cooperate with the imposed restrictions,” it added. With trucks, tempos and containers keeping off the roads, the Punjab government appealed to the public not to resort to panic buying of fuel, assuring them of the availability of adequate stocks. Secretary general of the Punjab Petroleum Dealers Association Rajesh Kumar said there are nearly 4,000 petrol pumps in the state and fuel supply has been affected due to the agitation since Monday. ""If this situation continues, we are staring at a dry-out situation soon which prompted us to write a letter to the Punjab chief minister...,"" Kumar was quoted by PTI as saying. Not just in Chandigarh, but district authorities of Hamirpur, Una and Bilaspur also issued directions for rationing of fuel, and the Himachal Roadways Transport Corporation (HRTC) has started rationalising routes. It has stopped the plying of buses on 138 routes with low occupancy, PTI reported. Impact of truckers' strike There are about one lakh trucks that ferry petrol and diesel as well as LPG from oil company depots to petrol pumps and gas distribution agencies. According to PTI, about 2,000 petrol pumps across the country have run out of fuel as people rushed in panic amid fears of the stocks running out. ""While state-owned oil firms had topped up tanks at most petrol pumps across the country in anticipation of the truckers' strike, some petrol pumps in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab ran out of stock due to heavy rush,"" an industry official was quoted as saying. The situation in southern India was reportedly better with no major supply disruption barring a few pumps in Hyderabad, the official said. It is being speculated that the essential supplies of vegetables, fruits and milk too may be affected if the three-day strike is extended or a pan-India movement is launched. Moreover, LPG supplies are also expected to be affected if the strike is extended further. The strike has impacted the movement of trucks in some western and northern states, they said, adding some LPG truck movement too has been impacted. However, there are no complaints about LPG shortage just yet as most users have double connections (two LPG cylinders) and reserve stock even if one cylinder gets exhausted. Why truck, bus and tanker operators are protesting Some truck, bus and tanker operators began a three-day strike on Monday against the stringent regulations under the new criminal law Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) for hit-and-run cases. The new law, which replaced the colonial-era Indian Penal Code, provides for a jail time of up to 10 years and/or a fine of ₹7 lakh for serious road accidents due to negligent driving and where drivers run away without informing the police. Truckers said most truck drivers choose to run away even in minor accidents as they otherwise will have to face mob justice and risk their lives. While the mobs typically go unpunished, to impose stringent punishment on drivers is unfair, they said. The All India Motor Transport Association — the umbrella body of truck operators — has not given a nationwide strike call. According to PTI, its representatives will be meeting home ministry officials to raise their concerns about BNS. Tapan Sharma, a former president of the Ahmedabad Motor Transport Association in Gujarat, told PTI that the protests occurred spontaneously. ""The association has not called for a strike. Drivers are acting independently due to concerns about the new law. They protest briefly and then move on. However, these sporadic demonstrations have caused delays in the delivery of goods.""","The Chandigarh administration imposed fuel sale restrictions amid a truckers' strike affecting fuel supply. Two-wheelers can buy 2 liters, while four-wheelers are limited to 5 liters. The strike protests against stringent penalties under the new criminal law for negligent driving. Panic buying led to fuel shortages at many pumps.",National News,2024-01-02 00:00:00

Study finds how MIND diet associated with better focus in school-aged children,"Arecent study suggested that a diet created to assist prevent cognitive decline in adults may also help increase attention in preadolescents. Future nutritional programmes aiming at enhancing children’s cognition may benefit from the findings. The new study looked at two dietary patterns: the heart-healthy Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, which combines the Mediterranean diet with the heart-healthy Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and the Healthy Eating Index – 2015 (HEI-2015), which is based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. “We assessed how adherence to these diets was associated with children’s attentional inhibition — the ability to resist distracting stimuli — and found that only the MIND diet was positively linked with children’s performance on a task assessing attentional inhibition,” said Shelby Keye, PhD, who performed the work as a doctoral student in the Department of Kinesiology and Community Health at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and will be an assistant professor there this fall. “This suggests that the MIND diet could have the potential to improve children’s cognitive development, which is important for success in school.” Keye will present the findings at NUTRITION 2023, the annual flagship meeting of the American Society for Nutrition held July 22-25 in Boston. Much like the DASH and Mediterranean diets on which it is based, the MIND diet emphasizes fresh fruit, vegetables, and legumes like beans, lentils, and peas. However, it also includes recommendations for specific foods, such as leafy greens and berries, which promote brain health. Although the MIND diet has been shown to have positive effects in adults, very few studies have been performed in children. The new research used data collected in a previous cross-sectional study led by Naiman Khan, PhD, a professor of Kinesiology and Community Health at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The study’s 85 participants ranged in age from 7 to 11 years old and completed a seven-day diet record from which the researchers calculated HEI-2015 and MIND diet scores. To assess attentional inhibition, participants also completed a task that requires spatial attention and executive control with their reaction time and accuracy recorded. Children with neurological disorders such as ADHD or autism were excluded from the study to reduce confounding factors. The researchers found that MIND diet scores but not HEI-2015 scores were positively related to study participants’ accuracy on the task, meaning that study participants who better adhered to the MIND diet performed better on the task. The researchers caution that although the study shows an association, an intervention study would be necessary to make any causal inferences.","A recent study suggests that adherence to the MIND diet, a combination of the Mediterranean and DASH diets with an emphasis on brain-healthy foods, positively correlates with preadolescents' attentional inhibition—the ability to resist distractions. Unlike the Healthy Eating Index – 2015 (HEI-2015), the MIND diet showed a significant association with improved performance on attentional tasks. This indicates the potential of the MIND diet to enhance cognitive development in children, crucial for academic success. Led by Shelby Keye, the research analyzed data from 85 participants aged 7 to 11, excluding those with neurological disorders. While the study highlights an association, further intervention research is needed to establish causal relationships between the MIND diet and cognitive function in children.",Lifestyle and Features,2023-07-31 00:00:00
Peer pressure keeps students away,"CHANDIGARH: Peer pressure, fear and sympathy for the student leaders are the major reasons why the students are staying away from classrooms. Interestingly, teaching in the colleges has been paralysed for more than ten days now. Girls return to GCG, Sector 11, everyday hoping that teaching would resume. But the student activists succeed in keeping them away from classes by repeating what the fee hike entails. They evoke sympathy for the students who cannot pay the enhanced fee. That does the trick. ""There is hardly anything to do at home so many of my classmates come to college. But we are stopped at the gate by the leaders who remind us of the pending demands and that there are no classes,"" says Manju of BA II of GCG, Sector 11. Interestingly, most of the students are not even clear about the main issues of the protest. This is where student activists step in. They spend a lot of time with the students to raise their awareness levels. ""We feel sorry for our juniors who had to pay the enhanced fee. This is why we support the leaders,"" said a student of DAV college. Even if one wishes to attend classes, student leaders stop the ''conscientiousâ€™ students at the entrance itself. ""Easily, ninety nine per cent of the students do not want to protest. They are more like silent supporters.

"Over 19,000 devotees have ‘darshan’ on 12th day of Amarnath Yatra","Wednesday’s group of devotees had pilgrims in both camps — the South Kashmir Nunwan (Pahalgam) base camp and the North Kashmir Baltal base camp.despite rain in the holy cave shrine area, over 19,000 devotees had ‘darshan’ on the 12th day of the ongoing Amarnath Yatra while another batch of 4,885 pilgrims left for Kashmir from here on Thursday. Braving rain and chanting slogans of ‘Bum Bum Bhole’, 19,631 Yatris had ‘darshan’ on Wednesday inside the holy cave shrine situated 3,888 metres above the sea level in the Kashmir Himalayas. Wednesday’s group of devotees had pilgrims in both camps — the South Kashmir Nunwan (Pahalgam) base camp and the North Kashmir Baltal base camp.Locals are lending a vital helping hand to the Yatris by providing ponies, porters, guides and even some carrying the elderly Yatris on their backs over the treacherous mountain track that becomes highly slippery during rain. Authorities have deployed security personnel on both the 48 km-long Pahalgam and the 14 km-long Baltal-Cave shrine axis. Around 150 ‘langars’ (community kitchens) run by over 7,000 volunteers work round the clock to serve fresh, healthy food to the Yatris. Community kitchens have also been set up at the transit camps of Manigam in North Kashmir Ganderbal district and Mir Bazaar in South Kashmir Anantnag district. Officials of Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) headed by J&K Lt Governor Manoj Sinha manage the affairs of the annual Yatra. In the 12 days since it started, over 2.50 lakh devotees have performed the Yatra. Out of the 4,885 pilgrims that left for Kashmir on Thursday, a total of 1,894 pilgrims in 86 vehicles left at 3.05 a.m. while the second escorted convoy carrying 2,991 Yatris in 105 vehicles left at 3.52 a.m. The first convoy is going to the Baltal base camp while the second convoy is going to the Nunwan (Pahalgam) base camp. Pilgrims use the nearly 300 km long Jammu-Srinagar national highway to reach the Valley. Given the unobstructed passage provided by massive security arrangements, both pilgrim convoys reach the Valley by early afternoon each day. No pilgrim movement is allowed from the transit camps towards the two base camps after 5 p.m. each day for the safety of the Yatris. Since it started on June 29, Amarnath Yatra 2024 has been proceeding safely and peacefully. The 52-day long Yatra will end on August 29 coinciding with Shravan Purnima and Raksha Bandhan festivals.","The ongoing Amarnath Yatra has seen over 19,000 devotees visiting the holy cave shrine despite rainy conditions in the Kashmir Himalayas.

In the autumn of life,"I started my career relatively early in life – at about 18 years of age, if that can be called early. The reason was more compulsion than focus on what I wanted to do, or could do – not that I had a clue about either at that point in life. The pros were many, as were the cons, like almost everything in life. However, that first assignment paved way for many more, successive ones, leaving me with little room to think about anything else in life, besides work. Not that there were or are any regrets. Personal life could hardly be called that for the simple reason there was neither much of it, nor much it gave. My perception of the institution of marriage was one of disdain, and motherhood held no meaning for me either. I would often wonder why and how women would undergo the ‘torture’ of balancing so many things in life – profession, marriage, family, and everything that came with it, leaving them, or a majority of those I had interacted with, exhausted. I simply couldn’t understand the ‘why’ behind it all. With the passage of time, I also noticed ‘my generation consistently opting for later marriages, if at all any. The option of starting a family would be a choice of convenience and not pressure. Yes, things had changed, until… Until one found love. Can one really find love? Is it not all around? Is it so hard to find, when it is all around? Yes and no, as it depends on what you are looking for. I found it, or hope to have found it (and hopefully preserve it), albeit ‘late in life’ (but then they say: “Better late than never!”). It was as sudden as those things determined by fate. One thing led to another, and before I knew it I found my resolve to remain unmarried dissolve rather rapidly, much to the surprise of friends and family, and not to forget myself. I never understood the catalyst that played a role in this rapid combustion of that strong-headed determination, but there it was. So, after the ‘lived happily after’, I, gradually, got back to what had been routine once. Everything seemed the same, but it was that added presence that supplemented value to my life. I began to realize what I had been missing all this while, after all. The husband wished to start a family, and the idea petrified me. At 42, what were even the chances? Forget about that, did it make any pragmatic sense? For me it didn’t. The topic didn’t mount pressure, but I was constantly aware of what he so much desired. He didn’t press. I didn’t broach the subject either. We left it to simmer; left it to time. Sometimes letting things be is indeed a good solution (the Beatles were not wrong!). I began to let the idea of starting a family germinate – an experiment of sorts. And germinate it did, stemming into a gutsy sapling. So, one fine day, without planning anything, and leaving the prejudices attached to advanced motherhood far behind, along with all fears and apprehensions, the ‘stork did come visiting’. It was, I must say a shock rather than a surprise, but with the passage of time, and the absolution of challenges, the journey has been an experience like no other – proof of the fact that in this universe, the impossible hold promise, that never-say-die is inherent to human nature and that courage does not always mean lack of fear.","The author reflects on their early career, which left little room for personal life. Despite initially disdaining the idea of marriage and motherhood, they unexpectedly found love later in life. The husband expressed a desire to start a family, leading the author to reevaluate their stance. At the age of 42, they decided to embark on the journey of motherhood. The author acknowledges the shock but emphasizes the transformative and courageous nature of the experience, challenging preconceived notions about timing and possibilities.",Human Interest,2021-04-09 00:00:00

"Gen AI adoption in India nearly universal, but training alone unlikely to bridge skills gap, says AWS survey","98% of organisations in India are using Generative AI tools and most are developing Gen AI training plans, but there is a limited understanding of employees’ skilling needs, according to a study commissioned by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in collaboration with Access Partnership. The study that surveyed 415 senior IT decision-makers in India across industries noted that 83% of organisations in India have appointed a dedicated AI executive, usually a Chief AI Officer (CAIO), to focus on adoption and implementation. Another 15% are planning to do so by 2026, according to the survey. However, the surveyed IT decision makers cited challenges such as limited understanding of employees’ Gen AI skilling needs, uncertainty about effective implementation, and budget limitations. “Given these limitations, training alone is unlikely to bridge the skills gap,” noted AWS in a press note. Even so, Generative AI talent is expected to be in widespread demand in almost all organisations in India, per the survey. AWS shared it had launched a Generative AI Innovation Center through a $100 million investment in order to help organisations access AWS AI expertise and experts through free workshops and training. AWS previously said it planned to invest $12.7 billion into cloud infrastructure in India by 2030.

The remaining five persons -- Nur Islam Mandal (40), Abdul Karim Mandal (30), Mojibar Rahman (46), Hamidul Islam (34) and Enamul Hoque (29) – were arrested from Assam. Enamul is a resident of Dhubri while the remaining four others are residents of Kokrajhar district of Assam. Giving details of the dismantling of fundamentalist/jihadi terror module, Assam Police Special DGP Harmeet Singh said that the arrests were made on the intervening night of December 17-18. He said that the eight persons are handlers in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and they were working to form 'sleeper cells' in different parts of India and there were plans to assassinate leaders belonging to Hindu community and RSS, besides undertaking violent and subversive activities in India. The police officer said all the eight arrested persons were brought to Guwahati and a detailed probe was underway to gather more information. The Special DGP said that the ‘Operation Praghat’ was launched in November after a detailed and prolonged examination of intelligence input regarding the clandestine anti-national activities being carried out by a group of individuals under the direction of Md Farhan Israk, a close associate of Jasimuddin Rahmani. Rahmani, according to the police officer, is the Chief of Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), an affiliate of Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, a global terrorist organisation. The operation was launched under the direct supervision of STF Chief Partha Sarathi Mahanta. Md Sad Radi visited Assam and West Bengal to meet sleeper cell activists of the banned ABT, before he moved to Kerala for the same purpose. Mobile phones with various suspicious apps, used for communicating with their handlers in Bangladesh and Pakistan were recovered from the detainees. Other items recovered from them include religious books with distorted narratives, printed and published in Bangladesh, four pen-drives with incriminating evidence, one Bangladeshi 'card', and various Bangladeshi certificates. Earlier this week, the Assam Police STF also arrested five Pakistan-linked terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) members from Kokrajhar and Dhubri. Four JeM operatives have been arrested from Kokrajhar district, while one JeM linkman was arrested from Dhubri district, a police officer said.","The Assam Police Special Task Force (STF), in collaboration with Kerala and West Bengal Police, dismantled a jihadi terror module and arrested eight individuals, including a Bangladeshi national, Muhammad Sad Radi. The operation, named ""Operation Praghat,"" was based on intelligence gathered regarding anti-national activities. Radi, along with two others from West Bengal, was arrested, while five more individuals were apprehended in Assam. The arrested individuals were linked to Pakistan and Bangladesh and were planning to establish ""sleeper cells"" across India, targeting Hindu and RSS leaders for assassination and carrying out violent acts. The investigation revealed that the group was coordinated by Md Farhan Israk, associated with Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), an Al-Qaeda affiliate. The police recovered incriminating evidence including mobile phones, religious books, and Bangladeshi documents. This operation follows the recent arrests of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) members in Assam, highlighting ongoing counter-terrorism efforts in the region.",Crime and Justice,2024-12-19 00:00:00

Sony keen on buying film rights of Steve Jobs biography,"LOS ANGELES: Sony Pictures Entertainment, the studio that produced highspeed and high-profile movies “This Is It,” with Michael Jackson, and “The Social Network,” about Mark Zuckerberg, could do it again with the Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. The studio late last week concluded a deal to buy film rights to the authorized biography “Steve Jobs,” from Walter Isaacson, according to a person who was briefed on the deal and spoke on the condition of anonymity because the studio had not authorized a public statement. A Sony spokesman declined to comment. Word that discussions were being completed was posted Friday on the Deadline.com website. Want a Loan? Get cash against your Mutual Funds in 4 hours After Jobs’ death Wednesday, Simon & Schuster, which is publishing the book, moved up its release date by a month, to October 24. And advance orders have been brisk, as readers hunger for more information about a leader who has emerged as the embodiment of creativity and enterprise that has appeared to falter in much of the business culture. Historically, movies have been developed slowly, and seldom tackled current events, as circumstances, interest and the national mood would often change in the years it took get a picture on track. But that has changed, as studios took advantage of faster digital production techniques, and showed a new willingness to keep pace with the increasing pace of the media world. After Michael Jackson’s death, the studio had his concert film, “This Is It,” in theaters within months. “The Social Network” was being written even as the book on which it was partly based, Ben Mezrich’s “The Accidental Billionaires,” was being rushed to publication.","Sony Pictures Entertainment has reportedly acquired film rights to the authorized biography ""Steve Jobs"" by Walter Isaacson, following Jobs' death. The deal, concluded late last week, hints at a potential high-profile movie similar to ""This Is It"" and ""The Social Network."" Simon & Schuster advanced the book's release to October 24, seeing brisk orders post-Jobs' passing. The film industry's shift towards faster production and current events reflects in this move, mirroring previous instances like the swift release of Michael Jackson's ""This Is It"" after his death. The rapid pace aligns with modern media demands and technological advancements.",Entertainment,2011-10-10 00:00:00

AHAM seeks CM’s intervention on multiple issues,"Tura, Feb 26: The AHAM CEB in Tura on Monday submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Conrad Sangma urging him to address several different issues which were also raised earlier. In the memorandum, the organization among others raised the issue of the State Job Reservation Policy and condemned the proposal made by Mawkyrwat MLA Renikton L Tongkhar for combined 80% reservation for Khasi-Jaintia and Garo and highlighted the importance of maintaining status quo. “The Founding fathers of Meghalaya have been a pioneer in inclusive development of the two tribes Khasi and Garo through the Reservation Policy and the vision is enshrined through this policy and the policy makers should understand the background of the policy before even raking up the issue,” it said. Another issue raised by the organization in the memorandum was the failure to complete the NH-62 (Dudhnoi to Dalu road) which it said, had resulted in inconveniences to the general public. According to it, the incomplete road infrastructure is not only hampering transportation but also posing significant challenges to economic development, safety, and overall well-being. “The National Highway 62 (NH62) connecting Dudhnoi to Dalu serves as a vital lifeline for the people residing in the region. However, the incomplete state of this road has resulted in numerous hardships, which require urgent resolution,” it added. The organization also raised the issue of the incomplete approach road from New Tura to the Tura Medical College site. “We are doubtful of the implementing agency in its ability to execute such a simple procedure even after years of implementing the project and call for your attention to the matter. In addition, the road that leads to Tura Medical College is still incomplete even after years of implementation of the project and the delay shall only bring negative impacts to the residents and beneficiaries of the people of Garo Hills,” it said, while seeking the Chief Minister’s intervention on the matter.","Tura, Feb 26: The AHAM CEB in Tura on Monday submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Conrad Sangma urging him to address several different issues which were also raised earlier.

SC rejects ED appeal against quashing of summons to Karnataka CM’s wife in MUDA case,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed an appeal filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) challenging the Karnataka High Court’s decision to quash summons issued to Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s wife, BM Parvathi, in connection with the Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA) scam case. A bench comprising Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran observed that political battles should be fought outside the court and questioned the ED’s role in pursuing such cases. “Unfortunately, I have some experience in Maharashtra. Please do not force us to say something. Otherwise, we will have to say something very harsh about the Enforcement Directorate. Let political battles be fought among the electorate. Why are you being used for it?” CJI Gavai remarked. Appearing for the ED, additional solicitor general SV Raju said, “Okay, we will withdraw. But let it not be treated as a precedent.” Rejecting the appeal, the court said it found no error in the reasoning adopted by the High Court single judge who had quashed the summons. “We do not find any error in the reasoning adopted in the approach of the single judge. In the peculiar facts and circumstances, we dismiss it. We should thank you, ASG, for saving some harsh comments,” the bench added. The case relates to allegations of corruption and irregular allocation of land by MUDA to Parvathi. As per the complaint, over three acres of land were ‘gifted’ to her by her brother Swamy, who had bought it in 2004 after it was acquired and de-notified. Although MUDA developed the land despite its private ownership, Parvathi sought compensation, allegedly receiving inflated compensation, including 14 developed alternate plots valued far higher than the original land under a 50:50 scheme. She later surrendered the land back to the authorities. Earlier, on March 7, Justice M Nagaprasanna of the Karnataka High Court quashed the ED’s summons issued to Parvathi as well as to Minister Byrathi Suresh, who was not named as an accused but was sought to be questioned by the agency. This led to the ED approaching the apex court, which has now upheld the High Court’s decision.","In a significant ruling, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) appeal against the Karnataka High Court’s decision to quash summons issued to Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah’s wife, BM Parvathi, in the controversial MUDA land scam case. The top court, led by Chief Justice BR Gavai, took a stern tone against what it viewed as the politicisation of law enforcement, stating, “Let political battles be fought among the electorate. Why are you being used for it?” The bench hinted at potential misuse of investigative agencies in political disputes. The ED, represented by Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, eventually agreed to withdraw the appeal, with the court warning that harsher remarks would have followed otherwise. The case alleged that Parvathi received inflated compensation and alternative developed plots after being “gifted” land originally acquired and developed by the Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA). However, she later surrendered the plots back. This Supreme Court decision reinforces the Karnataka High Court’s earlier ruling, which had also quashed summons to state minister Byrathi Suresh, suggesting a lack of clear evidence or justification for the ED’s actions.",Politics,2025-07-21 00:00:00
"Jheel clean-up works, birds arrive","HOWRAH: Santragachi Jheel, which till 10 days ago, was in news for all the wrong reasons, has turned into a tourist hot spot. At least 60 birds - both Indian and exotic - have made the 10-hectare waterbody their home since Thursday, drawing visitors in large numbers. The jheel is expecting quite a gathering this weekend. It seems that the initiative taken by a few responsible citizens a little over a week back is finally paying off. Till the middle of the month, the massive waterbody was teeming with water hyacinth, drawing media attention following complaints from locals. Till last year, the state forest department would clean up the jheel that technically belongs to the railways. However, this year, the forest department showed no sign of cleaning the lake even though the migratory birds' arrival was imminent. Concerned locals, who even gave the department repeated reminders, had almost given up the hope of seeing the birds this time. Finally, a group of citizens decided to take up the cause themselves. Among them is former cricketer Arun Lal, environment activists Mudar Patherya and Arjan Basu Roy and businessmen Sandip Seksaria and Jayanta Chatterjee and adman from Mumbai with city links, Peeyush Pandey. The initiative is being completely funded by them. Among the corporate houses that later collaborated are TIL, Quippo and Hindusthan Engineering and Industries Ltd. The mechanical equipmet required were given by the corporate houses free of cost. On Friday, locals said 30% of the lake had been cleaned up and hence the birds had started coming. People saw at least 60 birds swimming in the water and sitting on the islands of dried water hyacinth that have been created for them.","Santragachi Jheel in Howrah, recently plagued by water hyacinth, has transformed into a tourist attraction with the arrival of over 60 Indian and exotic birds.

Minister's bus charity drains state coffers,"Minister's bus charity drains state coffers KOLKATA: Freebies in the days of financial austerity?

The minister used his âdiscretionâ to allot 38 government buses on December 19 to ferryCPMsupporters to chief ministerBuddhadeb Bhattacharjeeâs meeting at Dattapukur Maidan in North 24-Parganas.Kundu fixed the rate at a mere `800 each, whereas the cost estimate made by transport department officials comes to `6,000 or more. According to estimates, the ailing South Bengal StateTransport Corporation(SBSTC) chalked up an additional loss of `2 lakh on that day.Kundu showered his magnanimity a second time last month during the rally organized by the Matua Mahasangha at Esplanade on December 28. The Matuas are a powerful pressure group with a vote base that is being wooed by every party. Kundu did his bit by allotting eight SBSTC buses to the Mahasangha to bring their supporters from Barrackpore at `1,500 only and another from Thakurbari at `2,000 - far below the prescribed rates. The corporation lst `40,000 more.Similar such ârequestsâ (read directives) from the minister have reached the other state corporations - CSTC, CTC and NBSTC - raising eyebrows in the secretariat, particularly when the government is passing through its worst financial crisis.The directives (copies of which are with TOI) reveal the minister is routing these âspecial casesâ through a particular officer of the SBSTC and making him do the dirty job. One such letter came from the CPMâs Habra zonal secretary Bablu Kar, who placed a request for 50 government buses for the CMâs meeting at Dattapukur at âfair rates.â Kar, in his letter, did not ask for any concession. It was the minister who himself wrote to the SBSTC managing director to treat the matter as a âvery special caseâ and allot buses at `800 a day.","Minister's bus charity drains state coffers KOLKATA: Freebies in the days of financial austerity?

"‘I dont like to show off,I like to tell a story’","For 12 years,Milan Luthria was one of many filmmakers crowding the margins of Bollywood,a director who cut his teeth on the chaos and camaraderie of Mahesh Bhatts film sets,and who went on to make competent formula films that drew crowds to single screens in the Hindi heartland. There have been more downs than ups in his career. He started with the success of Kachche Dhaage (1999),followed it up with the well-intentioned but cold Chori Chori (2003),went completely off-track with Deewaar (2004),showed edgy promise with Taxi No. 9211 (2006),and again went into oblivion with Hattrick (2007). Things changed with Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai (2010),a film on Mumbai don Haji Mastaan that successfully tapped the larger-than-life sensibility of Seventies Bollywood,and got both critics and front-benchers interested. But it is with the story of Silk in The Dirty Picture that the 44-year-old has truly arrived. Hes just won the Best Director award at the 18th Annual Colors Screen Awards. In this interview,he dissects his biggest hit,talks about meeting Silk Smitha and directing Vidya Balan. Excerpts:Is it true that you have interacted with Silk Smitha?I wouldnt go so far to say we interacted but I did meet her. She was shooting for a song in Mahesh Bhatts Naaraaz,which ended up being deleted. I was an assistant director in the film. No interaction was possible with her because she had reached a very hollow place. One could see that she was living in a cloud. When you talked to Silk Smitha,you realised that nobody was there. She had a team of people to convey our instructions to her. She was wonderful at her job but once the camera was off,she was a different person.Now that the film has made big money,had an impact and also won awards,what pleased you most about The Dirty Picture? And what is it that you wish you had done differently?Im pleased with the fact that I was able to achieve the balance between sexuality and emotion. It was a tightrope walk for a year.I had promised Vidya (Balan) that people would enjoy the sensual and sexual aspect and leave the theatre with awe and respect for her. I told Vidya that this film would be screened in her memory the day she dies.As a director,it was tough to get respect for a sexy subject. I was clear that I wasnt making a sex romp but telling the story of a sex object,who behind all her bravado,is a human being craving for emotional and familial acceptance.As for the negatives,its impossible not to look back and cringe. I cant watch my work. I can spot a thousand mistakes. Eventually,every filmmaker comes to the realisation that we are all flawed and so are our movies.When Vidya won the Best Actress trophy at the 18th Annual Colors Screen Awards,she said she was perplexed that you thought she could play Silk. She said,I dont know what was going on in Milans mind. Care to tell us what?(Laughs) Vidya is the classic voluptuous Indian beauty. I dont know why the Indian film industry didnt wake up to her before. She has shades of Hema Malini,Vyjayanthimala,Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit. Vidya is a complete Indian package. I felt that since she hasnt done something like this before,people would enjoy her in the role. Also since shes a south Indian,she fit the bill. She was my first and only choice.Even though The Dirty Picture is a womans story,it is told from a male gaze. Dont you think the emphasis on the skin show and the titillation defeats the purpose?I get the point youre making but let me say that I decided to explore and not exploit. The male gaze in the film is one of a caress and not carnage. The male gaze says its okay to embrace the lust in your mind and not to be afraid of it. The whole point is that the male gaze on a female is not bad,its sensual and not dirty. Its natural and erotic. One of the reasons to make this film was to bring the male gaze out of the closet. Nothing that we have shown in the film is not part of everyday life orgasms,S & M,sex with multiple partners it’s all part of life. We didnt want the men to watch the film alone. It was my conviction that the women would make the film a blockbuster and thats what has happened.Vidya told me that on the very first day you asked her to shoot the orgasm scene.Yes,I had to push her to the deep end from the beginning. I had to know if she would sink or swim. I thought we should know from day one rather than shoot for 10 weeks and then realise she couldnt go through with the role. I thought she would run away but she was brave.What was the most difficult scene that you shot with her?Where she ends up in the porn filmmakers studio. By then we had fallen in love with the character and,emotionally,it was difficult to see her go through this. It took a lot out of us to shoot the scene. I was very protective of Vidya when we were shooting it. Even when I was watching it,I felt awful,which made me realise that we are doing something right. I wanted this to be the audiences reaction too.From a director of films for men to a womans director,how would you describe your transition?I was getting sick of friends asking me why I always made guy films. As a filmmaker,you realise that scripts choose you. But I did have a desire to explore a womans story. Not a boring weepie,but a pulsating story of a woman. People around me said that I was taking a risk by stepping out of my comfort zone,my formula. (I thought) The Dirty Picture was waiting to be made.Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai,The Dirty Picture and now the sequel to Once Upon…,what is the secret of your chemistry with producer Ekta Kapoor?Theres a lot of mutual respect. I see Ekta as a courageous producer. Her strength lies in marketing and whenever I need a sounding board,shes available. Shes a full-on creative producer,not just a money person. She occupies the marketing zone while I stay in the creative. She doesnt get into my space and vice-versa.Youve been making movies for over 12 years but it’s only now that recognition has come your way. Why do you think youve been such a late bloomer?When I started,the trend was to segregate Bombay-centric films and the heartland films. Somehow,directors like Ram Gopal Varma and Karan Johar,who made the Bombay-centric films,got more recognition. Films that clicked in the heartland,like Kachche Dhaage,made money but they were not celebrated. My own record has been a bit of a see-saw. Chori Chori was bogged down by too many problems. Deewaar came after LoC and Lakshya when people were not in a mood to see a war film. Since then,its been a gradual upward graph. Taxi No. 9211 gave me critical and commercial acclaim and its gone well from there on. I guess it happens when it has to. Im grateful I was busy throughout.Do you remember the first time you said to yourself that you wanted to be a director?Yes,after a chance meeting with Mahesh Bhatt.

Told Canada it’s not Govt of India policy: Jaishankar on killing of separatist Nijjar,"In his first remarks on the row over Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegation of a potential Indian link to the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Wednesday that the government had told Ottawa that “this is not the Government of India’s policy”. Responding to a question on the Canadian allegation during an interaction at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Jaishankar said, “Yes, I do have a comment. I will share with you very frankly what we told the Canadians. One, we told the Canadians that this is not the Government of India’s policy. Two, we told the Canadians that look, if you have something specific, if you have something relevant, let us know. We are open to looking at it.”A day earlier, speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Jaishankar said “political convenience” should not be allowed to determine a country’s response to “terrorism, extremism and violence” — remarks construed as a veiled message to Canada and its Prime Minister. Targeting “rule-makers”, Jaishankar said that “respect for territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs cannot be exercises in cherry-picking” – a reference to Trudeau’s statement that any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil was an “unacceptable violation of our sovereignty”.While Jaishankar’s comments have also been perceived as directed at Pakistan and China, the reference to “rule-makers” points to Canada which is part of the G7 grouping and exercises influence because of its close alliance with the US. While these were his first remarks on the India-Canada row, he framed it in the context of a global rules-based order. He also underlined that “the days when a few nations set the agenda and expected others to fall in line are over”.","Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has addressed the recent controversy surrounding Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegation of a potential Indian link to the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Jaishankar stated that the Indian government informed Canada that such allegations do not represent India's policy and urged Canada to provide specific and relevant information if they have any. He emphasized that ""political convenience"" should not dictate a country's response to terrorism and violence, indirectly referencing Canada's stance. Jaishankar's remarks were made within the context of a global rules-based order, signaling that nations should respect territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs.",Miscellaneous,2023-09-27 00:00:00
Media houses shut down indefinitely,"The Arunachal Press Club (APC) and Arunachal Pradesh Union of Working Journalists (APUWJ) have decided to go for an indefinite shut down of all Itanagar-based media houses fearing law and order problem arising out of the proposed dharna by Students' Union Movement of Arunachal (SUMA) to be staged outside The Arunachal Times office on February 14 next. In a joint representation to the chief minister's office, it sought immediate suspension of DC Capital Complex Mige Kamki for issuing permission to SUMA to hold the rally against The Arunachal Times without verifying facts with the office or Arunachal Press Club (APC) or Arunachal Pradesh Union of Working Journalists (APUWJ). The Capital Complex DC's mindless action of granting permission to Students Union Movement of Arunachal to hold dharna against The Arunachal Times could undoubtedly result in confrontation between media persons and SUMA members, which has been coercing and threatening media persons to tow their line. This is unbecoming of an administrator for which we demand him to be suspended immediately and transferred out with immediate effect in public interest. The irrational and foolish demand of SUMA had been permitted by DC Mige Kamki and it gives out the message that the state government is a party to curtailing the freedom of press and media in the state, the letter read. It also sought refraining of SUMA president Biri Tabing and SUMA members from intimidating media houses and press persons in future and banning entry of any person into press houses and outlawing any person who enters press and media houses after 5 pm. ""SUMA is known throughout the state because of the wide publication given by the state media. Regrettably, of late this organization has started dictating terms amounting to muzzling the freedom of press and media"", the letter further read. The duo organisations also opined that if any untoward incidents occur wherein media houses and/or media persons are put to danger, the blame would be placed squarely on the shoulders the administration including the capital DC, SP and the state government. Along with the representation submitted to the chief minister, the CCTV footage showing the intimidation by SUMA members on February 6 evening at The Arunachal Times office, the show-cause notice served to SUMA on February 7 regarding their boisterous behaviour on various occasions amounting to curtailing of freedom of press including the incident on February 6 last and the letter submitted to DC Capital Complex proposing dharna outside the AT office on February 14 next was also attached. While it has always been our sincere effort to work for the greater interest of the people of the state to disseminate information, such impeding conditions make working extremely difficult. We issue our sincere apologies to readers and supporters for the inconvenience that this decision is bound to cause and at the same time hope to continue receiving your support during these testing times for the sake of freedom of press.",The Arunachal Press Club (APC) and Arunachal Pradesh Union of Working Journalists (APUWJ) have decided to go for an indefinite shutdown of all Itanagar-based media houses due to the fear of a potential law and order problem arising from the proposed dharna (protest) by the Students' Union Movement of Arunachal (SUMA) outside The Arunachal Times office on February 14.

China never provided tenable explanation for 2020 border actions: Jaishankar,"Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Jaishankar offered perhaps the most elaborate explanation in recent times of India’s border crisis with China External affairs minister S Jaishankar has said that China never provided a “tenable” explanation for its actions at the border in 2020 and that India warned Beijing after it amassed troops that the situation could lead to trouble before the Galwan clash took place, and China’s violation of agreements have immediate, medium term and even possibly long term implications. He said China’s actions have disrupted ties and contacts and left the relationship in an abnormal state with “a high level of military tension”, and impacted public sentiment in India, warning that tensions between the two biggest countries of Asia will have consequences for the world.","External Affairs Minister S.

Focus on unity: India takes G20 reins today,"amiliar with the matter said. Though the G20 has a structured agenda, counterterrorism remains an important issue for India and will be raised within the grouping at forums such as the foreign ministers’ meeting. On the finance track of the G20, the focus will be on ensuring inclusive and resilient growth following the global impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine crisis, the people said. India’s start of the presidency on Thursday will be marked by several people-centric activities, ranging from a “University Connect” programme involving students from 75 institutions that will be addressed by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, to lighting up 100 monuments across the country with the G20 logo, which draws inspiration from the colours of the national flag — saffron, white and green – and juxtaposes the planet earth with the lotus to reflect a pro-planet approach. The theme for India’s G20 presidency – “One Earth, One Family, One Future” – highlights the importance of having an approach that unites the world to address the future together, and of meeting the expectations of developing countries with regard to global challenges such as climate action. Addressing the final session of the G20 Summit in Bali, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the country’s presidency will be “inclusive, ambitious, decisive and action-oriented”. “We have to bring about unity, not divisiveness, at a time when the Global South is expecting the G20 will respond to global issues,” one of the people cited above said. “In our presidency, we will try to get a level of unity that can address the most challenging and pressing issues and we will keep divisiveness to a minimum level.” This includes divisions between the West and Russia over the Ukraine conflict, and India will act as a bridge so that G20 members can tackle pressing larger issues such as economic growth, indebtedness of countries and reviving the momentum for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). “We will need to engage every member. China is the world’s second largest economy and crucial for supply chains. You can’t talk about the indebtedness of states without China being a part of it,” the person said. In the context of debt relief, the people pointed to problems experienced by certain countries in India’s neighbourhood that were too reliant on external debt and experienced a lot of hardship since the pandemic. India will also work for reforms of multilateral bodies such as the Bretton Woods institutions — the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) — whose current mandate does not equip them to respond to contemporary challenges, including raising more finances through the private sector or providing financing for climate action. On the possibility of G20-related meetings being organised in Kashmir, Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh, the people said the calendar for more than 200 meetings before the G20 Summit in New Delhi in September 2023 is still being worked out. The outreach that begins on Thursday will be expanded to schools across the country to involve young people with the G20 presidency. There will be a selfie competition, with winners receiving G20-related goodies, sand sculpture events and release of video messages and radio jingles on Thursday. Ted Talks, quiz competitions and special sessions for youngsters will also be held at a later stage. These are all part of efforts to broadbase the messaging about the importance of India chairing the G20 and to include people at the grassroots as a “whole of country” approach. German ambassador Philipp Ackermann, who participated in a special briefing last week by the Indian government on the country’s G20 priorities, said: “India has an ambitious agenda for the G20 and that comes along with high expectations. India is not an average G20 country, it’s one of the clear heavyweights in the G20 and we are looking forward to working with our Indian friends.” Other G20 members such as Germany understand India’s agenda and priorities and will support it, Ackermann told reporters on Wednesday. “I think it’s a very important G20 presidency,” he added. There are also plans to showcase festivals in different regions – such as Makar Sankranti in January and Shiv Ratri in February – as part of steps to highlight the best of Indian celebrations and events among G20 members over the next year. As Nagaland’s Hornbill Festival, a major tourist draw in the northeastern region, is set to start on December 1, it will be showcased during the commencement of the G20 presidency. The G20 Summit, the people said, will be the largest and most multilateral event to be organised by India since independence. Whereas China organised meetings at 14 locations during its 2016 G20 presidency and Indonesia held meetings at 25 locations this year, the Indian side plans to hold meetings at more than 50 locations. These meetings will be part of the finance track that focuses on eight issues such as infrastructure financing, health finance, and financial sector reforms, the sherpa track that focuses on 12 topics such as anti-corruption, agriculture, digital economy and climate, and 10 engagement groups involving private organisations and civil society. There will also be B2B events and a business summit before the G20 Summit. Official meetings will include visits to iconic historic sites located near venues, such as Hampi, Ajanta, Ellora and Khajuraho. The leaders of the G20 members — Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, the US and the European Union — are expected to attend next year’s summit. They will be joined by the representatives of international bodies such as the UN, World Bank and International Monetary Fund and the leaders of nine guest countries — Bangladesh, Egypt, Mauritius, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Singapore, Spain and the UAE.","India assumed the presidency of the G20 on Thursday, marking the beginning of a year-long effort to unite the world to address common challenges such as climate change and economic growth.

Polish judges urged to 'fight every inch' for independence,"The president of Poland?s supreme court has urged the country?s judges to ?fight for every inch of justice? as the rightwing government pushes for changes that critics say would make judicial independence a ?pure fiction?.?For over a year I have been repeating that the courts are easily turned into a plaything in the hands of politicians,? Ma?gorzata Gersdorf told her colleagues in an open letter read out at a recent gathering of judges in Warsaw. ?What was until now a threat is becoming a reality.?In its latest battle with Poland?s legal system, the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) says it wants to ?democratise? the way Polish judges are appointed, which at the moment is a job for the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), an autonomous body whose judicial members are chosen by their peers.Under the government?s proposals, however, the terms of all the judicial members of the council would be terminated within 90 days of the draft law?s enactment. Their replacements would be selected by the Polish parliament, with the speaker of the parliament given discretion as to which candidates should be put forward for consideration.Whereas the council?s judicial members presently enjoy a majority, under the government?s proposals the body would be split into two chambers, one for judicial members and the other for political representatives. Both chambers would have to agree to an appointment or a resolution, giving the political representatives a veto over decisions made by the judicial members.?The government?s proposals will be an instrument for ensuring the appointment of the ?right? kind of judges who will not be too critical of the authorities and their political programme,? said Ewa ??towska, a professor at Poland?s Institute of Legal Sciences and a former judge who served on the country?s constitutional tribunal and the supreme administrative court.The council was given less than three working days to respond to the draft act, receiving it from the Ministry of Justice on a Thursday and expected to provide its official response by the following Tuesday. In a strongly worded statement, it described the proposals as ?in obvious and gross contradiction with the Polish constitution?.?The council is an independent constitutional organ that was instituted in 1989 in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary, because in the communist era everything was dependent on the ruling party,? Dariusz Zawistowski, chairman of the KRS and a serving supreme court judge, told the Guardian.?When members of the council are elected by the parliament, this function of safeguarding the constitution will be pure fiction. Formally speaking, there would be no independent judiciary.?Gersdorf has urged her fellow judges to risk their own positions in the fight against the proposals.?There is no fight without victims, and among them may be counted some of us present here,? said Gersdorf?s letter to her fellow judges. ?To win, you must be prepared even for disciplinary tribunals, to be removed from office, for anything. You must show that we are in opposition to the pushing of a democratic state into oblivion.?The government describes the proposals as ?enhancing democracy and independence? by freeing the appointments process from ?the corporate interests of the judicial environment?, citing the judicial appointments process in countries such as Spain and Germany.?Objectivity in selecting members of the National Council of the Judiciary and their independence from corporate interests is to be ensured by them being selected by the Sejm, which holds a mandate gained in democratic elections. A similar system is successful for instance in Spain,? said the Ministry of Justice in a statement.But the KRS?s response rejects such comparisons. ?It must be recalled that in accordance with article 8(1) of the constitution, it is the constitution of the Republic of Poland of 2 April 1997 that is the supreme law in the Republic of Poland, and not the constitution of Spain of 31 October 1978 or the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany of 23 May 1949.?The controversy is the latest front in a protracted battle between the PiS and an increasingly demoralised judiciary.Shortly after assuming power in late 2015, the government merged the office of prosecutor general with that of the justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, a move that some analysts argue has already allowed the government to exert political pressure on judges.?We have already seen numerous examples of prosecutors answerable to the minister of justice initiating criminal proceedings against judges who have reached decisions they don?t agree with,? said ??towska.","The President of Poland's Supreme Court Malgorzata Gersdorf has urged the country's judges to ""fight every inch"" for justice as the ruling party plans to ""democratise"" the way judges are appointed. Under the government's proposals, the terms of all judges will be terminated within 90 days of the draft law's enactment and their replacements would be selected by Polish parliament.",Local News,2017-02-28 00:00:00

"J&K floods: Water level in Srinagar recedes; 76,500 rescued, 4 lakh still trapped","SRINAGAR: Water levels have started receding in Srinagar city, one of the worst hit by the deluge, facilitating rescue workers to pluck out another 29,000 persons to safety but four lakh people were today still waiting for help in the flood-ravaged Kashmir Valley. Scaling up rescue work, the Army and IAF have deployed 329 columns and 79 aircraft and helicopters to evacuate those stranded and provide food and medicines. ""A massive rescue and relief operation by Indian armed forces is continuing on a war footing in Jammu and Kashmir with over 76,500 persons rescued so far by the Armed forces and NDRF in different regions of the state"", PRO, Defence, Col G D Goswami said today. ""79 transport aircraft and helicopters of Indian Air Force and Army Aviation Corp have been pressed into service. Army has deployed 329 columns of its personnel for rescue and relief operations, in which 244 columns deployed in Srinagar region and 85 columns in Jammu region"", he said. In general the water level is receding but areas downstream of Jhelum River are experiencing increase in water levels, he said. ""In Srinagar town there is a decrease in water level by 3 to 4 feet since the beginning of the floods, whereas there is a rise of 6 inches in Wuller Lake. Manasbal Lake saw a reduction by 3 inches bringing the water level to 18.3 feet, which is still 4.3 feet above danger mark,"" the PRO said. Srinagar town remains the most critical part of flood hit areas. ""All those areas where it was not possible to reach earlier remain the focus of the rescue mission today,"" he stressed and added that the reas of Rajbag, Jawahar Nagar, Gogji Bag and Shivpora where the bulk of the stranded people are located saw major effort for evacuation. While greater desperation was seen in areas which are on the outer fringes, people in the interiors of these colonies are displaying a great sense of responsibility and directing the rescue teams to those people who are worse affected. Many camps of Army located in South Kashmir and Srinagar have also been flooded and over 1000 Army personnel and families are stranded without food and water. Water, electricity, supplies and other services have been hit within the cantonments. Authorities were also trying to fix telecommunication links snapped since Sunday afternoon on a war footing and hope to restore it in a phased manner. As the miseries faced by people — some of them perched on rooftops — in the worst floods to hit Jammu and Kashmir in six decades unfolded, the death toll in the floods, landslides and house collapses triggered by torrential monsoon rains since Tuesday last was stated to be around 200. In an endeavour to provide speedy medical aid to the affected populace, 80 medical teams of the Armed Forces Medical Services have also swung into action. The Army has distributed 8,200 blankets and 650 tents, 1,50,000 litres of water, 2.6 tonne of biscuit, 7 tonne baby food and 28,000 food packets in the flood-affected areas. Additional water bottles are being airlifted from Chandigarh and Delhi, he said.

Apple to make over 50 million iPhones a year in India,"Apple is looking to make over 50 million iPhones in India annually within the next two to three years, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. Once the company achieves this, India would account for 25% of global iPhone production. The company tends to achieve this by creating an ecosystem of its suppliers in India and also looks to produce additional tens of millions of iPhone units after achieving the 50 million mark, the report said, citing sources. Despite this, China, however, will continue to remain the largest iPhone producer, accounting for over half of iPhone output. Lately, Apple has boosted its reliance on India in recent years despite challenges including complex infrastructure and restrictive labor rules that often make doing business in India, harder than in China. Among other issues, labor unions retain clout even in business-friendly states and are pushing back on an effort by companies to get permission for 12-hour work days, which Apple suppliers find helpful during crunch periods, the report said. Among Apple’s lead suppliers, Taiwan-based Foxconn, believes the initial push into India has gone well and this is laying the groundwork for a bigger expansion, the report said, citing sources. Apple is emblematic of a move among companies worried about overdependence on China to move parts of their supply chains elsewhere, most often to Southeast Asia and South Asia. Diplomatic efforts by the US and its allies to block Beijing’s access to advanced technology and strengthen ties with New Delhi have accelerated the trend. The first phase of a Foxconn plant under construction in the southern state of Karnataka is expected to start operating in April next year, and the plant aims to make 20 million mobile handsets annually, mainly iPhones, within the next two to three years, according to the report, citing people with direct knowledge of the construction plans. A mega plant is on Foxconn’s drawing board with capacity similar to the one in Karnataka, although the plans are still in a nascent stage, the people said. Apple also has chosen India as its site for a manufacturing stage for lower-end iPhones to be sold in 2025. In this stage, known as new product introduction, Apple’s teams work with contractors in translating product blueprints and prototypes into a detailed manufacturing plan. Until now, that work was done only in China, The Wall Street Journal said. According to the report, combined with plans for expanded production at an existing Foxconn plant near Chennai and at another existing plant recently bought by Indian conglomerate Tata, these developments signify that Apple intends to have the capacity to make at least 50 million to 60 million iPhones in India annually within two to three years. Lately, Foxconn indicated its commitment to India by announcing that it was investing the equivalent of more than $1.5 billion in the country. Global iPhone shipments last year totaled more than 220 million, according to research firm Counterpoint, a number that has remained steady in recent years. “India’s trust factor is very high,” the report quoted Ashwini Vaishnaw, communications and IT minister. This year, for the first time, India-made iPhones were introduced on the first day of global sales of the latest model, eliminating the lag with China-made phones. Supply-chain executives say hourly wages are now significantly lower in India than in China, but other costs such a transportation remain higher, and labor unions sometimes resist rule changes sought by manufacturers, The Wall Street Journal said. In May, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu state, where Foxconn’s flagship Chennai plant is located, said he would withdraw regulations allowing a 12-hour workday, weeks after the state passed an amendment authorizing the longer hours. The chief minister, MK Stalin attributed the decision to opposition from labor activists. Karnataka has stood by a decision earlier this year to extend the workday to 12 hours, up from a previous limit of nine hours, though companies must seek approval to do so. After years of battling local content rules and other red tape, Apple this year opened its first retail stores in India. The report , quoted Abhilash Kumar, an India-based analyst at TechInsights, as saying that the top-of-the-line iPhone 15 Pro Max was selling well in the country, though it costs about $700 more than in the US. Apple also is making progress in India toward building a network of core suppliers, long a strength of Chinese manufacturing. Officials said this week that Japanese battery maker TDK would build a new factory in India’s Haryana state to manufacture battery cells to power Indian-made iPhones. The moves don’t mean Apple and its suppliers are leaving China. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has traveled to China twice this year, stressing the country’s importance. He visited Luxshare, a China based assembler that is taking a bigger role in the China portion of iPhone assembly, the report said. On social media, Apple has assured Chinese consumers that iPhones selling in authorised channels are made in China. Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said in November that China would continue to account for the largest share of Foxconn’s capital investment next year. Liu has visited India at least three times in the past year and a half, meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other officials.","Apple aims to manufacture over 50 million iPhones annually in India within the next two to three years, representing 25% of global iPhone production, according to The Wall Street Journal.

‘Accountant of Auschwitz’ to go on trial in Germany in April,"A German court says a 93-year-old man dubbed the ‘accountant of Auschwitz’ will go on trial in April on allegations he was accessory to 300,000 murders as an SS guard at the Nazis’ death camp. The Lueneburg state court said on Monday Oskar Groening’s trial would open on April 21.","In a significant move toward justice for Holocaust victims, German authorities announced that Oskar Groening, a 93-year-old former SS officer known as the ""accountant of Auschwitz,"" will stand trial beginning April 21, 2015. Groening is accused of being an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people during his time as a guard at the notorious Nazi death camp Auschwitz. Although he did not personally execute prisoners, his administrative role — particularly in managing and sorting valuables taken from victims — contributed to the operation of the extermination system. The Lueneburg state court will conduct the trial, which underscores Germany’s commitment to prosecuting those responsible for Nazi atrocities, even seven decades after the events occurred.

Muzaffarnagar riot victims look for a change,"Questioning the state Government’s decision to raze the relief camps set up in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts for riot victims, Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati said the Samajwadi Party regime had failed to live up to the expectations of the people, who were now looking for a change. “What happened in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli was shameful. But what is happening now is a disgrace to humanity. The camps of the riot victims are being razed and the victims are now forced to live in the open in this biting cold. This shows the insensitivity of the state Government,” Mayawati said while addressing BSP office-bearers here on Monday. The BSP supremo had called a meeting of senior party office-bearers, including parliamentarians and legislators, to discuss the proposed ‘Savdhan Rally of the party, to be held in the state capital on January 15. She discussed the prevailing situation in the state and also gave directives to the party workers. “The situation was so bad in the relief camps that court, Minority Commission and National Human Rights Commission had to intervene and ask the state Government about the steps it had taken to provide relief to the people living there,” Mayawati said. The BSP chief said that law and order in the state was already bad and the way Akhilesh Yadav Government had tackled the Muzaffarnagar riots and post-riot situation had proved without doubt that this Government was not concerned about people at all. Incidentally, when Mayawati was raising questions on the relief camps, the Centre asked the Uttar Pradesh Government about the number of deaths of children in the relief camps at Muzaffarnagar and Shamli. “The Muzaffarnagar riot was a well-hatched plan of Samajwadi Party and Bharatiya Janata Party as both of them are using religion for their political gains. Both the parties plan to use the situation arising out of the riots in the coming lok Sabha elections,” she said. Mayawati asked her party leaders to gear up for the Savdhan Rally on January 15. She set targets for BSP leaders and legislators. The party expects over 15 lakh people to attend the rally to be held at Rama Bai Maidan on the outskirts of the city. “Ensure a large attendance of people in the meeting. Go to every village, tehsil and block and meet the people and motivate them to attend the rally,” Mayawati told the party workers.

Police rubbish report of truckers being beaten up,"A day after it expressed concern over the report of truck drivers being beaten up in the state and forced to flee to neighbouring Assam, leaving their vehicles behind, the state police on Monday termed the report “rubbish.” Inspector General of Police, Chukhu Appa, said the report of drivers and handymen of a particular community fleeing the state, especially in Kurung Kumey district, was “rubbish” and “without any iota of truth.” He said that no passenger vehicle was plying due to the lockdown. Kurung Kumey DC Kento Riba said on Monday that a truck had hit a parked SUV at Sangram on Saturday, which led to an altercation between the drivers, which, he said, “was given a different colour by some official.” An officer of the civil supply department had in a letter to the DC on Sunday informed that truck drivers and handymen of a particular community were beaten up between Sangram and Palin by a few youths, forcing them to flee to Assam. The DC said the officer has been reprimanded for the inordinate delay in informing him about the incident. A police team led by a sub-divisional police officer was sent to the spot to settle the issue of compensation, and a case was registered against the driver for his fault, he said. “Three rice-laden trucks reached Kurung Kumey HQ Koloriang on Sunday evening and retuned smoothly,” the DC said. “Trucks carrying essential commodities are plying even on Monday, but continuous landslide at Leel being the only problem for which men and bulldozers are deployed to clear the road,” he said over phone from Koloriang. The deputy commissioner said the situation in the district is totally normal and all residents, including non- Arunachalees, are living peacefully by staying indoors due to the ongoing lockdown, while all drivers and handymen of vehicles carrying essential commodities are discharging their duties. (PTI)","The state police in Arunachal Pradesh dismissed reports of truck drivers being attacked and forced to flee to Assam as ""rubbish"" and baseless. They clarified that no passenger vehicles were operating due to the lockdown, and an altercation between drivers was mischaracterized. The situation was resolved, and essential commodity trucks continued to operate smoothly. The district administration confirmed that the situation in Kurung Kumey district is normal, with residents abiding by lockdown measures.",Local News,2020-04-07 00:00:00

FIH Pro League: Indian women’s team seeks redemption against China,"Indian women’s hockey team captain Salima Tete is hoping her side can take a cue from their male counterparts as they head into a crucial double-header against China in the FIH Hockey Pro League (Women) 2024-25. With their backs against the wall, India will be aiming to snap their losing streak when they face their Asian rivals on June 28 and 29 in Berlin. Tete’s team is drawing inspiration from the Indian men’s side, who ended their Pro League campaign on a high last week with a spirited win over Belgium. That victory lifted them to eighth place on the table, finishing just above Ireland. While China is currently placed in the fourth position in the Pro League points table, India is placed at the bottom — in the ninth position with England ahead by a point in the eighth place with both teams yet to play two matches in the league. “It is a very crucial double header for us over the weekend. But we will draw inspiration from the Indian Men’s Team who finished with an inspiring win against Belgium,” Salima said. She further emphasised that, “This Pro League outing has been a learning experience with several grey areas that we need to work on as a team. We will be introspecting on this performance when we go back home but for now our focus is on doing well against China”. India will take confidence from their last outing against China where they beat them 3-0 in the pool stage and 1-0 in a closely-fought final to win the Asian Champions Trophy in Bihar in November 2024. However, in the previous season of Pro League, India had lost 1-2 in the double header. “They are a known opponent to us, from our regular outings in the continental championships we are aware of their potential. They are a tough team to beat but we will play to our strengths,” Salima concluded.","Indian women’s hockey team captain Salima Tete hopes to draw inspiration from the Indian men’s team, who ended their FIH Pro League campaign with a spirited win over Belgium.

Over 4.6 lakh samples tested for COVID-19,"Out of 4,60,665 samples tested for COVID-19 in the State since the outbreak of the pandemic, 27,540 were found infected by the virus. This was stated by Health Director Dr K Rajo during a weekly media briefing held at the Medical Directorate, Lamphelpat today. With more and more people opting for home isolation in case they get infected by COVID-19 and in view of the declining number of positive cases, the State Government has already decided to close down six COVID Care Centres, Dr Rajo said. Till December 17, the State recorded 332 COVID-19 related deaths while the total number of active cases was 1,872. The month of October witnessed the highest number of positive cases while maximum COVID-19 deaths were recorded in November, said the Health Director. Even though the recovery rate has now improved to 91.97 per cent which means the fight against the virus has been effective. The Disaster Management Act 2005 and the Manipur Essential Services Maintenance Act 2010 were invoked to ensure that health care services are provided properly to the public. Disciplinary actions were initiated against some people who violated these Acts, Dr Rajo conveyed. After thermal screening of people at Mao Gate and Jiribam was discontinued since December 14, COVID-19 screening at Imphal airport was also stopped from December 17, he said. Although positive cases have been declining, COVID-19 positive people are still dying in the State. As such, awareness campaigns on COVID-19 (Jan Andolan) would go on till March 2021, Dr Rajo informed. He said that media took a major role in containing the COVID-19 pandemic in the State. State Surveillance Officer Dr N Somorjit informed that the serosurveillance work undertaken in four districts since November 30 is almost complete.

Attempts to create India-Afghanistan divide wonâ€™t succeed: MEA to Pak,"Reminding Pakistan that its prime minister, Imran Khan, had last year admitted that Pakistan still hosts 30,000 to 40,000 terrorists, India on Friday said Islamabad's attempts to ""create a divide in the traditional and friendly relations between the people of India and Afghanistan will not succeed"". This came a day after Pakistan accused New Delhi of distorting the contents of a report on terrorism by the United Nations Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team. ""This reveals that India's agenda is to create complications for the Afghan peace process,"" Pakistan's foreign ministry had said. The Ministry of External Affairs' official spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, ""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan would do well to recall that their prime minister admitted last year that Pakistan still hosts 30,000 to 40,000 terrorists.

On June 2, India had expressed ""serious concern"" over a United Nations report which stated that a large number of foreign terrorist fighters, including up to 6,500 Pakistan nationals, are operating in Afghanistan.

Farmers hold ground,"By keeping it pointed and apolitical, the farmers’ movement has got to be the scene stealer of the year If there’s any civil movement that scored this year, it has got to be the farmers’ sustained campaign against the three farm Acts and their fierce commitment to protect their rights, refusing any sort of compromise. They shut out politicians, shunned activists, did not seek help from any quarter, blocked roads and camped at Delhi’s borders to be heard. And not only forced senior Union Ministers to engage with them but have their langar food. They made cogent arguments about how the new laws would weaken their kind in the wake of the corporatisation implicit in them. They carefully avoided any politicisation of their cause or hijacking of agenda by vested interests. And they had concrete examples of how the Government’s earlier attempts at revamping the agriculture sector had not had the desired effect. For example, at yesterday’s meeting with the Government, representatives of protesting farmers showed how corporates had defrauded farmers in Madhya Pradesh, promising to pick up crops but not doing so in the end, leaving scores of farmers in Hoshangabad and Guna in the lurch. Some traders, they argued, bought crops from farmers and then bolted without paying them in full. The farmers are not against market economics but simply want a level-playing field. Experts may argue that the protest is being led by cultivators from Punjab and Haryana, who have benefited because of the Government’s guaranteed pickup of volumes and fixed rates, namely the Minimum Support Price (MSP), and are stuck on cash-rich prospects of wheat and rice. Of course, this assurance has meant an over-dependence on water-intensive crops like paddy and wheat, which is depleting the aquifers and crop diversity. However, farmers argue that they would be incentivised to grow other crops provided the MSP was guaranteed for all and not selectively and new laws alone would not even out the imbalance. In the end, the Government has to give a price guarantee of sorts as the MSP has itself become unremunerative given rising input costs, with farmers forced to sell at lower rates. Farmers are but naturally wary of competitive prices in the open market that would lower their earnings and have a cascading effect on even the protected one. In such a scenario, the Government has to probably do some direct cash transfers to farmers, grading their capacities, as a transitional measure to a new system. The small and marginal farmers, the lot of whom the Acts intend to improve, would not gain that much either given their limited resources to transport their goods to local mandis, leave alone bigger markets outside. Besides, given their low volumes of output and without proper warehousing and processing, they would, therefore, be dependent on food majors. With most of them not literate enough about exercising their rights, dispute resolution could also end up being loaded against them. Although the farmer can now enter into a contract with a corporate entity at a mutually agreed price, the mechanism for price fixation is not codified and farmers fear that corporations could use their might to manipulate or browbeat them into accepting their terms. A licence won’t be required to trade in farm produce and anyone with a PAN card can now buy directly from the farmers. Farmers want they be registered too, considering they have a trusted bond with their existing commission agents, as their licence is proof enough of their credibility and delivery abilities. Farmers are not entirely without reason, battling as they are bad loans and non-payment of sugarcane dues in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The opposition to farm laws could have been avoided had the government preferred Standing Committee scrutiny over pushing the law unceremoniously with a voice vote in the Upper House. A GST-like consensus involving Centre and states would have helped. There was no attempt at consensus-building, no dialogue with the farmers’ unions, State Governments or the Opposition parties. Since agriculture-related issues come under the State List in Schedule VII of the Constitution, the Centre should have consulted States. One just had to look at the playbook of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government on the contentious issue of contract farming, which was envisaged in the National Agriculture Policy, 2000. Instead of bringing a Central law, it circulated a Model Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act to the States for adoption in 2003. The ensuing UPA-I Government continued the policy. Contract farming was included as an option in the National Farmers’ Policy, 2007. By August the same year, a total of 15 states had brought amendments in the APMC (Regulation) Acts based on the model legislation. The intransigence on the farm Acts is in contrast with the Government’s handling of the recently enacted labour codes. Although these had some controversial provisions, since they reduced 29 existing labour laws into four legislations, there was not much hue and cry as they were vetted by the department- related Standing Committee of the Lok Sabha. Yes, there is a need to reform agricultural marketing in the time of food surplus. But care should be taken to ensure that the farmers are legally protected in what is still an unequal deal. If only the Acts came with the caveat that “notwithstanding anything contained in the aforesaid sections, no trade transactions should take place below the notified MSP”, the farmers could have been easily pacified. In the end, they make 60 per cent of the country’s population, a voter base that no political party can ignore. And as the local body polls in Haryana show, the ruling BJP has already suffered a blow.","The farmers' movement in India has been a significant civil movement this year, focusing on protecting their rights and refusing compromise. They have blocked roads, blocked roads, and urged senior Union Ministers to engage with them.

Twitter makes first interest payment on Elon Musk buyout debt,"Twitter Inc. made its first interest payment on the $12.5 billion in debt that Elon Musk used to take the social media giant private last year. The company paid a group of seven banks, led by Morgan Stanley, which became stuck with the debt after they were unable to sell it to outside investors. Representatives for Morgan Stanley and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The first coupon was expected to cost Twitter roughly $300 million, according to Bloomberg calculations and market participants not involved in the Twitter deal. The payment was due around Jan. 27, about three months after the transaction closed. A lot is riding on these interest payments. Questions remain about Musk's ability to turn around the social media giant, though the fact that he's made good on the first chunk of interest expense stands to bolster confidence in his ability to avert a bankruptcy in the near term. Since his purchase, Twitter has failed to pay millions of dollars in rent for its San Francisco headquarters and London offices, has been sued by multiple contractors over unpaid services and has auctioned off everything from bird statues to espresso machines to raise money. He's also openly floated the idea of bankruptcy, cited a ""massive drop"" in revenue as some advertisers fled from the platform, and slashed staff since closing his $44 billion leveraged buyout at the end of October. Yet Musk has also said Twitter's finances are improving. He said in a late December ftvitter Spaces conversation that the company has about $1 billion in cash on its balance sheet and is now on track to ""roughly ' hit cash flow break-even following all the cuts. Musk is now in the process of overhauling the company. He previously teased turning Twitter into something called ""X, the everything app."" He's also taken an active role in suspending accounts. Big debt bill While Twitter made its first interest payment, its debt load is still a heavy burden. Annual interest is expected to exceed $1.2 billion, some of which carries floating rates that could continue to increase as the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates. Twitter paid less than $100 million of annual interest expense before Musk bought the company by loading it up with debt. The pile includes a $6.5 billion loan that banks originally hoped to sell to institutional investors and $6 billion of bridge loans, split equally between a secured and unsecured tranche, that banks had planned to sell in the form of junk bonds. Representatives for Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. declined to comment.

Govt draws up list of local bodies facing water crisis,"The cities of Patna, Chandigarh, Delhi, Pune, Indore, Nashik, Ludhiana, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Agra, Ghaziabad, and Hyderabad are among those that face a severe water crisis, according to a study by the ministry of housing and urban affairs. The ministry plans to address this crisis, in part, by launching a people’s movement , and hopes to do this by the end of November in the most water stressed parts of the country. This year, Chennai and Bengaluru have witnessed a significant water crisis, highlighting the vulnerability of large metropolises to water shortage. In all, according to the ministry, 255 districts (India has a total of 725 districts), 756 urban local bodies (ULBs; municipalities and corporations), and 1,597 blocks across the country face a severe water crisis and shortage of drinking water from a rapid decline in ground water levels due to indiscriminate extraction, erratic monsoons, and unauthorised development. The ministry of housing and urban affairs has prepared guidelines for urban water conversation which will be implemented in two phases in collaboration with the ministry of Jal Shakti’s flagship scheme, Jal Shakti Abhiyaan. In the first phase, 496 ULBs have been identified in 200 districts (the work here will happen between July 1 and September 15). In the second phase, between October 1 and November 30, the guidelines will be implemented in 260 ULBs in 55 districts. According to government think-tank NITI Aayog, India is facing water crisis with around 50% population experiencing high-to-extreme water shortage. “In order to address water scarcity, it is important to undertake efforts for conservation, restoration, recharge and reuse of water. In this pursuit, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) is participating actively in the Jal Shakti Abhiyan along with states and union territories and Urban Local Bodies ,” an official working closely with the project at the ministry of urban affairs said on condition of anonymity. The Jal Shakti Abhiyan is India’s newly launched water mission. The ministry has identified four main areas under the programme: Rain Water Harvesting (RWH), reuse of treated waste water, rejuvenation of water bodies, and plantation. “The crux of this drive is building large scale awareness campaign so that conservation of water becomes a Jan Andolan (popular movement),” the official added. The most affected districts identified by the Centre lie in Uttar Pradesh (35) with 84 ULBs followed by Rajasthan (29) with 111 ULBs and Telangana (24) with 29 ULBs. These areas have been identified as the most water stressed ULBs and will be covered in the first phase. The second phase has water stressed ULBs affected by returning monsoon with the most districts being in Tamil Nadu (27), Karnataka (18) and Andhra Pradesh (9). The ministry has asked ULBs to engage with Resident Welfare Associations, schools, businesses, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), Nehru Yuva Kendras (NYKs), NSS volunteers, NCC cadets and others to organize a door- to-door outreach, community events and workshops for dissemination and building awareness for all four enlisted water conservation measures in urban areas. The ministry has also asked ULBs to enforce building by-laws as per the provisions of the model building by-laws (MBBL) 2016 to ensure that the rain water harvesting provisions are incorporated. And it wants them to also monitor this closely. The ministry has proposed the creation of a Rain Water Harvesting Cell which will be responsible for effective monitoring of Rain Water Harvesting in the city. It will also monitor the extent of ground water extraction and ground water aquifer recharge. The National Urban Sanitation Policy 2008 mandates reuse of at least 20% of treated waste water. “ In all new government buildings/Group Housing Societies, public buildings, whenever building plan is approved, it should be ensured that there should be dual piping as has been provided in City/State/UT BBLs, “ the guidelines state. The ministry of urban affairs is tasked with providing water supply and sewerage under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). The key aim of the scheme is to ensure that every household has access to a tap with the assured supply of water and a sewerage connection. “AMRUT guidelines allow funding for rejuvenation of water bodies in AMRUT cities. ULBs should undertake rejuvenation of at least one water body in their jurisdiction, availing the funds under AMRUT,” the ministry’s guidlines for funding the programme state. In cities not covered under AMRUT, ULBs should utilise state funds, grants available under 14th Finance Commission or State Finance Commission, explore financing through Corporate Social Responsibility funds of companies, even monetise some of their land holdings, the ministry has suggested. “To implement something effectively, the best source through which you can go are Urban Local Bodies because it is in their direct mandate to implement all this and it is a good decision to do so. But at the same time, urban development including water management at local level is a state subject, it has to be adopted by the state government and then passed on to the ULBs for it to be effectively implemented. The procedural change needs to be established otherwise it is good move and the right way to implement water conservation,” said KT Ravindran, professor and head of urban design at the School of Planning and Architecture of New Delhi.","The cities of Patna, Chandigarh, Delhi, Pune, Indore, Nashik, Ludhiana, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Agra, Ghaziabad, and Hyderabad are among those that face a severe water crisis.

Patience has ended: India,"India today bluntly told Pakistan that it should not remain under any illusion that it can capture Jammu and Kashmir and warned that New Delhi’s patience with terrorism had exhausted. Foreign Secretary Chokila Iyer made these observations to the expelled Pakistan High Commissioner Ashraf Jehangir Qazi who met her this afternoon for 30 minutes on a courtesy call before he leaves for Pakistan on May 26. A spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs told reporters that the Foreign Secretary told Mr Qazi in no uncertain terms that “no one in India takes the possibility of a war lightly. Ms Iyer pointed out to Mr Qazi that India had been responding in “a calculated and gradual manner” since the terrorist attack on Parliament on December 13. The Pakistani envoy was told that it was incorrect on behalf of Islamabad to view the current situation between the two countries merely as an attempt at “ratcheted” tension. “Our patience with terrorism has exhausted.” The spokesperson quoted the Foreign Secretary as having told Mr Qazi that “Pakistan should not live under any illusion that it can capture Jammu and Kashmir. Kashmir was, is and shall remain an integral part of India.” The Pakistani envoy was told in clear terms that Islamabad had still not been able to read the mood and determination of this country to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Ms Iyer said Pakistan’s approach towards “genuine concerns” of New Delhi on terrorism was “unacceptable” to India. India felt that the problem lay in Pakistan’s attitude of “compulsive hostility”. Despite violence, the Indian leadership tried to engage in the dialogue process, hoping that Pakistan would give up the path of violence to create a congenial atmosphere for good neighbourly relations. “However, time and experience have proved otherwise,” she said. The envoy was told that for India the December 13 attack on Parliament was a “watershed”.",India has warned Pakistan that it cannot expect to capture Jammu and Kashmir and that New Delhi's patience with terrorism has been exhausted. Foreign Secretary Chokila Iyer met with Pakistan High Commissioner Ashraf Jehangir Qazi before leaving for Pakistan on May 26.

Kai Po Che' is about middle class Indian youth: Abhishek,"Friendship and male-bonding are a recurring theme in his films but director Abhishek Kapoor says in his upcoming release 'Kai Po Che', he has explored the aspirations of Indian youth. Set in Gujarat, the film is an adaptation of Chetan Bhagat's third novel 'The 3 Mistakes of My Life'. ""It's a film about friendship and just a coincidence that both my films are about friends. But if you compare beyond that, both the films are dramatically different films. ""Here, the character are relatable. It's a very deep rooted Indian film about middle class India and youth.

Delhi Metro may become largest metro system outside China,"The Delhi Metro, which has issued tenders for the topographical survey of its six lines under Phase 4 approved by Delhi government, plans to start construction by August. The lines under Phase 4, in addition to the 140 kilometres added in Phase 3, are expected to free up traffic bottlenecks in congested central and southern parts of the city, and help passengers from outer Delhi.Phase 3 of Metro?s expansion is likely to be completed by mid-2017. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has been seeking approval to start Phase 4?s construction for over a year. The new phase will particularly benefit south Delhi as residents will have the option of taking the Metro to go to the airport.After the completion of Phase 4, the Delhi Metro will become the largest Metro system outside China to carry about seven million passengers every day. Right now, it is the 11th largest Metro system. After Phase 3?s completion, we should be fourth or fifth.The DMRC has proposed to build a 20-km corridor between the existing Aerocity and Tughlakabad Metro stations. The line will go through densely populated areas of Sangam Vihar, Saket, Mehrauli, Vasant Kunj and Mahipalpur of south Delhi. The Delhi government rejected a proposal to extend it to the Terminal 1 station.

Once this line, which is part of Phase 4 of DMRC, is completed, passengers will have different options of going to the airport. From Aerocity, they can take the Airport Line to go to Terminal 3,? said a senior DMRC official.Phase 4 will add to the ridership of the Airport Line. Almost 15 kilometres of this line will be underground because of space constraints. DMRC officials said they hoped the problem of overcrowding would be solved when lines under Phase 3 of the mass transit system?s expansion become operational.In May, the AAP government gave in-principal approval but the Centre returned the file, saying they need to give financial approval.

Sportingly fashionable!,"From being mere sportsmen, they have become larger than life, youth idols for the country. Take a look at any of the top Indian cricketers today; whether it's Mumbai's favourite Sachin Tendulkar or Punjabi puttar Yuvraj Singh, or even Ranchi's golden boy M S Dhoni, each one of them has created their own distinct style statement. While Yuvi created headlines for his funky pairs of glares, Dhoni's ever changing hairstyles and more recently his association with the Kolkata fashion week grabbed news feed.Not far behind are the likes of Zaheer Khan, Virender Sehwag, Robin Uthappa, Anil Kumble, Irfan Pathan, Ishan Sharma and Sreesanth who have all taken to the ramp at some point or the other.With the fashion industry burgeoning in the country, and more and more cricketers being signed onto the endorsement bandwagon, it's only natural for the gap between the two diverse fields to narrow down. The players of today are 'all rounders' and know how to look good on and off the game.With the introduction of the IPL matches last year, cricket got a dose of glam with numerous Bollywood stars buying teams. And where there's Bollywood, style can't be far behind with topnotch designers working on the player's uniforms. Designer Surily Goel who did the outfits for the Kings XI Punjab team in the first season says it was a challenging task. 'There were a lot of limitations in terms of choice of colours and fabrics and I had to ensure that it was cricket friendly. With the IPL becoming such a big phenomena, cricketers have become a lot more stylish and are dressing up for the after parties and such. Each of them have a large fan following and I think they're realising the need to look good,' says Surily. Manish Malhotra known for his Bollywood designs, last season at the Mumbai Fashion Week presented a line inspired by the Kolkata Knight Riders team. 'It was great fun designing for Shah Rukh Khan's team. I used black and gold as the main colours and put together kurtas with lycra pants and sports shoes as well as sarees with a sporty look, that added a new dimension to my usual designing style,' says the designer who feels cricketers bring in their own personality to fashion. Designer Kunal Rawal who got the opportunity to work on the uniforms for the Rajasthan Royals team says he was very excited since the team had already won the first season. 'There was a lot of controversy surrounding the matches due to the change of location but I used that to my advantage by adding an African element to the uniforms. I wanted to show their youth and confidence, so I designed tees with faces of deer emblazoned on them. Golden buttons embossed with Indian monuments added the royal touch,' says Kunal who feels that it's only after the IPL that people are connecting cricket with fashion. Could our stylish cricketers be replacing leading actors? Rocky S feels designers have exhausted Bollywood actors on the ramp and are now looking for a change, 'Our players have become big ambassadors and have a huge audience connect. In fact, some of them have become larger than our superstars. I wanted to get away from Bollywood and hence chose Sehwag as my showstopper for my collection at KFW. I felt he was apt being the vice-captain of the team. Though he wasn't accustomed to the ramp, once he got up there, he totally took over.' He adds that sportsmen have become trendsetters of sorts all over the world. Just as David Beckham creates waves for his changing dress style, so do our players.

Bitcoin ETF craze drives 'nothing for sale' rally,"Bitcoin is climbing for a fourth consecutive week, with the digital token's price lingering just below an 18-month high of $38,000, as more investors bet that US exchange-traded funds that hold the largest cryptocurrency are on the verge of winning regulatory approval. ""We are referring to the current Bitcoin rallies internally as, 'nothing for sale' rallies, said Stephane Ouellette, co-founder and chief executive of FRNT Financial. ""On even the slightest positive news, whether ETF related or otherwise, Bitcoin is seeing very little resistance to the upside and is having the propensity to 'gap.' The dynamic speaks to the impressively strong price base Bitcoin has developed post-FTX."" Bitcoin rose as much as 2.5% to $37,465 on Friday. It climbed within a hair of $38,000 on Thursday, the highest price since May 2022. That was when the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin set off a chain of failures across the sector that culminated in the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange a year ago from tomorrow. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF by Jan. 10, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. Bitcoin has surged almost 40% over the past four weeks on growing speculation that approval was imminent. And it's not just Bitcoin rallying, battered coins like Terra are up 66% today, and FTX's native token, FTT, has surged 79.8%, according to data from CoinGecko. Cryptocurrencies also appear to be benefitting from an evolving economic outlook. With stocks rising and bond yields falling, the appetite for riskier assets such as crypto is seen rising. Bitcoin is still only about halfway toward reclaiming the heights of the 2021 crypto mania, when it peaked at close to $69,000. However, Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management, said while short-term forecasts in crypto are difficult to predict, the digital asset’s long-term prospects appear nothing but positive. “If you look over the next year, it’s hard not to be really bullish on crypto and on Bitcoin,” Hougan said. “We’ll see new all-time highs.”","Bitcoin is on a four-week climb, hovering just below an 18-month high of $38,000.

"Gadkari, Chouhan dropped from BJP's top board, Laxman and Yediyurappa in","THE ASIAN AGE. | SANJAY BASAK Published : Aug 18, 2022, 6:59 am IST Updated : Aug 18, 2022, 7:17 am IST Yogi's exclusion causes surprise, Fadnavis in election panel The shake-up in the organisation is being viewed as the complete consolidation of the Modi-Shah hold in the BJP. (File Photo: PTI) New Delhi: It was a rude awakening for a section of senior BJP leaders when the high command dropped Union minister Nitin Gadkari and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan from its parliamentary board, the highest decision-making body in the party. In a major organisational reshuffle on Wednesday, the party brought in six new faces in the parliamentary board, including former Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa and former National Minorities Commission head Iqbal Singh Lalpura. While Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and senior party leader Om Mathur were inducted into the Central Election Commission(CEC), Shahnawaz Hussain, the only minority face in the CEC, was dropped. Eyebrows were also raised as Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath did not find any place in the parliamentary board despite aÂ strong buzz about his inclusion. The entire shakeup in the organisation is being viewed as the complete consolidation of the Modi-Shah hold in the BJP. Besides Mr Yediyurappa and Mr Lalpura, other new faces on the board included Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal, former Lok Sabha MP Satyanarayan Jatiya, BJP National OBC Morcha president K. Lakshman and national secretary Sudha Yadav. Besides the top two, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh remains a part of the board. The party also rejigged the CEC and named Mr Fadnavis, Om Mathur, Bhupendra Yadav and Mahila Morcha president and MLA from Coimbatore (South) Vanathi Srinivasan among the new faces. The only Muslim face in the CEC, Shanawaz Hussain, was dropped. The others dropped from the CEC include Jual Oram and former BJP Mahila Morcha chief Vijaya Ratnakar. Following the reshuffle, both the board and the CEC now have full members. While the CEC has 15 members, the highest policy-making body, the parliamentary board, has 11 members. Shockwaves ran through the BJP old guard as both road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari and Mr Chouhan were dropped from the board. When contacted, some senior leaders refused to comment, and only said that âthis is surprisingâ. Sources in the party attributed Mr Gadkariâs sudden exit from the board due to the âprevailing undercurrentsâ between him and the Prime Minister. It may be mentioned that Mr Gadkariâs remark during the anti-farm laws agitation that everyone has the âright to protestâ apparently went against the PMâs observation on the protesters as âandolan jeevisâ. Some of the senior leaders said that âGadkariji, a high-performance minister, is perhaps the only one who takes his own decisions to run his ministryâ. The leaders felt Mr Gadkariâs âmarginalisationâ was now becoming more and more apparent. In 2019, he was divested of shipping and water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation. He was also divested from the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises which was earlier given to him. What also reportedly went against him was a constant buzz in the saffron corridors that Mr Gadkari âwas PM materialâ. Some felt that Mr Gadkari managed to remain afloat only because of his strong âconnection with the RSS headquarters in Nagpur, also his Lok Sabha constituencyâ. It may be recalled that in 2014 while Mr Modi was being propped up to be the PM face of the party, another section floated the name of Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Sources said even though Mr Chouhan was reinstalled as chief minister after the Kamal Nath-led Congress government fell in 2020, âhe could never be a part of the Modi-Shah campâ. A senior party leader asserted that âunlike most of the ministers and influential leaders in the BJP today, Shivraj is a powerful mass leader and can hold a state on his ownâ. After his stellar performance in the UP polls, there was a strong buzz in the party that UP CM Yogi Adityanath was all set to make it into the partyâs highest policy-making body. His failure to enter the parliamentary board is also viewed as a âsimmering undercurrent between him and the national leadershipâ. The UP CM, who too has emerged as a mass leader, was never viewed as a part of Delhi leadership. After the exit of Mr Gadkari and Mr Chouhan, the only veteran leader who continues to remain in the parliamentary board is defence minister Rajnath Singh. It may be recalled that during the tenure of Mr Shah as party president, veteran leaders L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi were gradually eased out and made members of the âMargdarshak Mandalâ. While there has been no official reaction to the shakeup yet,Â some party functionaries described it as an âemphasis on diversityâ. They said that the ânew parliamentary board shows how the party rewards old workers and values the experience of its karyakartasâ. They added: âPeople like BSY, Satya Narayan Jatia, K. Laxman have given their lives to the party, building it brick by brick from the start. Their coming to the highest decision-making body offers a glimpse of how the party values its esteemed karyakartas. There is evidently an emphasis on diversity. Sarbananda Sonowal is from the Northeast, and K. Laxman and B.S. Yediyurappa hail from the South. Iqbal Singh Lalpura is the first-ever Sikh in the parliamentary board.â With Muslim leaders making an exit both from the Rajya Sabha and parliamentary board, Iqbal Singh is the partyâs new minority face. As for 78-year-old Mr Yediyurappa, he has been brought in ahead of the Assembly elections that lie ahead in Karnataka. end-of Tags: bharatiya janata party ( bjp), b s yediyurappa, nitin gadkari, shivraj sigh chouhan Location: India, Delhi, New Delhi Latest From India Modi to get Shiv Sanman Puraskar on February 19 Budget: Tax relief unlikely, sops for untapped sectors Modi Slams Opposition MPs for Disrupting Parliament President Murmu says Ram Mandir, eco reforms key achievements","In a major reshuffle, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) dropped Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan from its parliamentary board, the highest decision-making body in the party.

Four models of corporate entrepreneurship,"Opportunist, enabler, advocate and producer are the four models of corporate entrepreneurship that Robert C. Wolcott and Michael J. Lippitz discuss in ‘ Grow from Within Mapping the models on two dimensions, viz. organizational ownership (ranging from diffused to focused) and resource authority (ad hoc to dedicated), the authors find that all companies begin as opportunists. “Without any designated organizational ownership or resources, corporate entrepreneurship proceeds (if at all) based on the efforts and serendipity of intrepid ‘project champions’ – people who toil against the odds, often creating new businesses in spite of the corporation.” However, the opportunist model works well only in trusting corporate cultures that are open to experimentation and that have diverse social networks behind the official hierarchy, say Wolcott and Lippitz. “There need to be multiple executives who can say yes to a new business concept. Without that type of environment, good ideas can easily fall through organizational cracks or receive insufficient funding to prove feasible.” In contrast to the opportunist model of diffused ownership and ad hoc resource allocation, the enabler model has dedicated resources. “Early stages of new business conception are explicitly supported, encouraged, and often strategically channeled, with a promise of serious management attention to those concepts that look promising.” The book describes Google as the poster child for the enabler model. “Project teams form on the fly, based on requirements that are defined by the teams themselves… If a project team believes that it has a winner, it appeals to the Google Product Council for formal project funding… The Product Council meets weekly to hear new business ideas.” The enabler model is not just about allocating capital for corporate entrepreneurship, the authors clarify. “Personnel development and executive engagement are also critical.” In the third model, the advocate (with focused ownership and ad hoc resource allocation), a company assigns organizational ownership for driving the creation of new businesses to a designated corporate-level group, but it intentionally provides the group with only a modest budget. Advocate organizations act as evangelists and innovation experts, facilitating corporate entrepreneurship in conjunction with business units, which must demonstrate their commitment to new business development by paying most of the bills, as the authors note. They see DuPont, the 200-year-old global conglomerate, as a pioneer of this model of new business creation, and BP, the UK-based international oil giant, as having an advocate-style organization to drive IT-based transformation across the company. “A fundamental challenge for advocate organizations is to maintain a balance between explorations of longer-term, game-changing concepts and producing tangible near-term results. It takes time to fill the pipeline, and individual projects may have a long gestation period.” The fourth model, the producer, with focused ownership and dedicated resources, aims to protect emerging projects from turf battles, to encourage cross-unit collaboration, to build potentially disruptive businesses, and to create pathways for executives to pursue careers outside their business units, Wolcott and Lippitz explain. “Modern producer organizations are closely tied to corporate leadership and strategy, and they provide a great deal of support for the commercialization, transition, and scaling of new businesses.” Recommended addition to the professional managers’ shelf.","Summary: Robert C. Wolcott and Michael J. Lippitz outline four models of corporate entrepreneurship in their book ""Grow from Within"": opportunist, enabler, advocate, and producer. The opportunist model begins without designated ownership or resources, relying on project champions within trusting corporate cultures. The enabler model provides dedicated resources and support for new business conception, with Google serving as an example. The advocate model assigns ownership for new business creation to a corporate-level group with a modest budget, acting as innovation facilitators. The producer model, with focused ownership and dedicated resources, aims to protect projects, encourage collaboration, and align with corporate strategy. Each model presents unique challenges and opportunities for corporate entrepreneurship, providing valuable insights for professional managers.",Business and Finance,2010-01-01 00:00:00

Failed society. It's what we are,"Every 20 minutes, a rape is reported to be committed somewhere in the country. What a testimonial for a nation claiming to be the world's largest vibrant democracy, besides a hoary, hallowed civilisation! We have female deities but we exploit women Nothing has really changed since the despicable Nirbhaya gang rape over four years ago. A daily average of six rape cases in Delhi alone sends shivers down the spine. How often one is left to stare at screaming newspaper headlines narrating macabre episodes, one more gruesome than the other, of not only young girls but even toddlers brutalised by runaway youths, many among them juveniles, reinforcing pervasive public perception of audacity and fearlessness of morbid young minds, administrative inertia, effete governance, and the bankruptcy of social systems. The National Crime Records Bureau reveals that, among India’s cities, Delhi registered 25.7 per cent of all cognizable crimes in the country in 2015, earning the sobriquet of India’s ‘crime capital’, ‘rape capital’, ‘stalking capital’. The crime data that Delhi Police has just revealed shows how perilous the nation’s capital remains, particularly for women, who make a distress call to the helpline every nine minutes on an average. Allegations of crime against women in the city include a molestation plaint every two hours, and a rape case every four hours. The city led the rest of the country with 1,636 incidents of rape in 2013, rising to 2,166 in 2014, 2,199 in 2015, and marginally falling to 2,155 cases filed in 2016. And now there are rape videos on sale. Every 20 minutes, a rape is reported to be committed somewhere in the country. What a testimonial for a nation claiming to be the world’s largest vibrant democracy, besides a hoary, hallowed civilisation! We revere our country as Bharat Mata; we respect womanhood as nothing short of devi or mother. Instead, in reality, we remain guilty of horrendous crimes against women, shameful treatment of the girl child, in embryo and after birth. Undoubtedly a complex issue, it encompasses steadily eroding filial and societal norms and values as much as growing anomaly for and alienation from the state. The rape of these innocent women is, in fact, the rape of India’s soul and spirit; that’s how it occasionally galvanises men and women, young and old, in pain and anguish. The rot runs deep. A complete subversion of means and ends has turned the life of Indian society upside down, to the point that there are acts which, although no doubt, criminal, are seldom condemned by the collective consciousness: kidnappings and rapes, smuggling and terrorism, thefts and murders, violation of laws and rules, criminals becoming public heroes, mafia gangs looming large with a halo of public acclaim. With strange impunity, cartels of avarice and extortion grow and prosper with uninhibited bravado, undeterred by the fear of the state or society. India’s body social suffers from multi-organ failures. Its numerous rudderless youths remain bereft of any values imbibed at home or in school or from the vicinity; indeed, they learn a lot — how to exploit and extort, how to seek; not to strive. The Bollywood bonanza on the idiot box fuels this new-found urge among them to ape the celluloid hero and possess the artefacts of fanciful lifestyle; lurid films and songs add to the malaise. Good examples are the best teachers. But, what examples do we get from Government and Parliament, schools and surroundingsIJ The ubiquity and magnitude of scandals and scams has benumbed the people’s conscience, breeding cynicism and disaffection for the very institution of democracy — as practised in the country. Even khap panchayats, ever belligerent on community honour, remain inert. An image of an effete, confused, pusillanimous leadership endures. The multi-layered governance leviathan remains immune; there is no clear accountability, no swift, deterrent punitive action. Shaken by the ‘high profile’ ghastly cases such as the Nirbhaya criminalisation, one believed the long arm of the state and the countrymen’s conscience would work as an effective deterrence against such barbaric acts. Notwithstanding the rape laws and conviction process rendered stringent, Delhi Police data reveal that only 29 per cent of the cases ended in conviction in 2015. Characteristically, the cases linger for long, each case taking an average of five years to be decided. It transpires that, of the 17,301 heinous crimes reported across the National Capital Region in 2014, chargesheets were filed in 5,346 cases and only 919 of the accused were convicted. The State Security Commission, overseeing such complaints, has not met for three years. While there is no deterrence by way of swift, exemplary punishment for the culprits, the Delhi Government leaves an unfortunate impression of a largely narcissistic dispensation, remiss in providing assured remedial infrastructure such as robust public transport, installation of CCTV/GPS in buses, autos and taxies. Even after the police identified 2,177 ‘dark spots’, like south-west and south Delhi as most vulnerable to crime, and recommended provision of adequate street-lights, most of them remain defunct or non-existent. The judiciary procrastinates, the police is lackadaisical. Delhi, with its adjoining areas for perceptible reasons, breeds cartels of depravity and decadence. For some days, many years ago, the perfidious Delhi Bagiya tandoor case was the talk of the town. A coincidence it was that a local leader was in the eye of the storm, an archetypal familiar figure strutting along in the capital city, signalling that the high and mighty, the nouveau riche and the political neophyte, the tough and the strong will get away even with gross savagery inflicted on the meek and infirm. Bringing to the fore the travails of the Peruvian society, from which a parallel can be drawn for India, Hernando de Soto’s The Other Path: The Economic Answer to Terrorism, constitutes an indictment against the ineptitude and discrimination of the state in the Third World. The state as a rule legislates and regulates in favour of small pressure groups — what De Soto calls “redistributed coalitions” and discrimination against the interest of the large majorities whom this system punishes. Again, Julia Preston and Samuel Dillon, in Opening Mexico: The Making of a Democracy, talk of the disgust and cynicism of Mexicans, which led to a standard formation of rescue brigades which later spawned grassroots political organisations. A new paradigm of public anger, the ire and angst of the people, is a veritable powder keg, more so because it is sincere and silent. This catharsis of inner outrage implies that wages of sin will, in the end, permit no escape from retribution. The country’s mute majority is jolted by the young living with a profound sense of grief, reminding them of the insight from the American singer, John Gorka’s famous refrain, “The old future’s gone”. We may, or may not, yet be a failed state; with our decadent values, ethics, and mores, but we can’t deny we are a failed society.","The article discusses the alarming frequency of rape cases in India, highlighting Delhi's notorious reputation as a crime capital. Despite stringent laws and public outcry, the issue persists with grim statistics revealing frequent assaults on women, including minors.

"PM, CM escalate K'taka battle","Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah were engaged in a bitter war of words on Tuesday as the Assembly poll campaigns hot up. Modi took a jibe at Siddaramaiah and said his decision to contest from two seats and fielding his son in May 12 polls was the Kannada version of Congress’ family politics. The Chief Minister was quick to hit back at the Prime Minister, saying, “2 Reddys+1 Yeddy was Modi’s formula to win the election”. “I was reading the newspaper a couple of days ago and I found that in Karnataka, the 2+1 formula is going on. This is nothing but the Kannada version of Congress’ family politics. Due to the fear of defeat, he (Siddaramaiah) went in search of another seat,” Modi said while addressing a rally at Santhemarahalli. Siddaramaiah unleashed a tweeter barb at the PM reminding Modi that he too had contested from two seats during the 2014 lok Sabha elections. Attacking Modi over the BJP fielding tainted Reddy brothers in the Assembly elections, the Chief Minister said, “2 Reddys+1 Yeddy is Modi’s formula to win the election.” “Today, the Prime Minister avoided talking about his complicity in closing CBI cases against the Reddy brothers. Instead, he spoke about some 2+1 formula. Here is the explanation of his formula to win the election. 2 Reddys+1 Yeddy,” Siddaramaiah said in another tweet. ‘Yeddy’ is a reference to BJP’s chief ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa. The Chief Minister asked Modi to worry about his party as it would not cross 60-70 seats. Siddaramaiah tweeted, “PM repeats the lie of increasing crime rate for political purposes. I challenge him for an open debate on a single platform on crime and law & order situation in Karnataka vis-a-viz BJP-ruled States.” Siddaramaiah is contesting from Chamundeshwari constituency in Mysuru and Badami in Bagalkot district. Siddaramaiah’s candidature from Badami came amid reports that the battle at Chamundeshwari was not easy for him. His son Dr Yathindra is contesting from Varuna constituency in Mysuru, which has been Siddaramaiah’s constituency since 2008. Two of the Reddy brothers — Gali Somashekhara Reddy and Gali Karunakara Reddy — have been fielded from Bellary and Harapanahalli, both in Ballari district, respectively. Gali Janardhana Reddy is out on bail and is campaigning for his close confidant B Sriramulu, who has been projected as Deputy Chief Minister if the BJP comes to power. Janardhana Reddy has been seen with BS Yeddyurappa in a roadshow at Molakalmuru constituency campaigning for B Sriramulu. Even though BJP national president Amit Shah had told a Press conference recently in Mysuru that party has nothing to do with Janardhana Reddy, the party has given him all the importance which might help him revive his political future. Plunging in the battle of Karnataka for the first time on Tuesday, the Prime Minister addressed three rallies across the State. The BJP has pinned its hopes on Modi to change the prospects of the party, which is trailing on second place behind the Congress in majority of the opinion polls. Significantly, addressing a massive rally at coastal town of Udupi in south Karnataka, Modi slammed Congress president Rahul Gandhi for insulting former JD(S) supremo and Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, a powerful Vokkaliga leader. The JD(S) could emerge as a kingmaker in case of a hung Assembly. Vokkaligas or Gowdas, a farming community with over 12 per cent of the population, are a deciding factor in many constituencies in old Mysuru and a few other parts of the State. In Karnataka politics, Vokkaligas and lingaytas are dominant communities. Modi said, “HD Deve Gowda is a senior and honourable former Prime Minister. There might be political differences between parties but civility and respect should be maintained. The Congress president’s disrespect towards Deve Gowda ji is not acceptable. If such is their mindset, how can they think good for people of KarnatakaIJ You have to teach them a lesson.” “Whenever former Deve Gowda ji visits me in Delhi I always welcome him with respect and always give him time. The way Rahul Gandhi talked about him recently is shameful,” he added. Incidentally, just 24 hours ago Deve Gowda had categorically said that he will never go with the BJP and if his son Kumaraswamy compromised with the BJP he will be excommunicated from the family. PM Modi’s comment on Deve Gowda came at a time when the Congress labeled the JD(S) as ‘B-team of the BJP’ in this election. Addressing his first rally at Santhemarahalli in Chamarajanagar, Modi challenged Rahul Gandhi for debate on development of Karnataka. “He (Rahul Gandhi) had challenged me that if he speaks for 15 minutes then I will not be able to stand in front of him. Yes, you are right, you are a ‘naamdar’, what right do we ‘kaamdaars’ have to even sit in front of you,” Modi said. “For 15 minutes, without taking a paper in your hand, can you please talk about the achievements of your Government in KarnatakaIJ You can speak in any language as you please — English, Hindi or your mother tongue Italian,” Modi added challenging Rahul for a debate. Focusing his attack on Rahul, Modi went on to say, “Perhaps due to over excitement, the newly elected Congress president forgets decency,” he said. “He did not even bother to congratulate the hardworking ‘mazdoors’ due to whom India’s villages are getting electricity. I want to ask those who ruled India for a majority of the years since 1947 --why did they not think about the 18,000 villages lacking access to electricity.” He also brought out Vande Mataram controversy to take a jibe at Rahul Gandhi without naming him. “The Congress is led by leaders who have no respect for India’s history. I was shocked that they even went to the level of disrespecting ‘Vande Mataram’,” the PM said. At Udupi, he slammed the Siddaramaiah Government for failure of law and order and unleashing vendetta politics against BJP worklers. “Violence cannot exist in a democracy. It is shameful how the BJP karyakartas were murdered in Karnataka. The Congress must answer on increasing crimes,” the PM said. “When the lokayukta in the State is not safe, how can one expect the common people to be safe under the Congress Government,” asked Modi. “The Government is talking about enhancing ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in the country, but the Congress believes in ‘Ease of Doing Murder’. This is the culture they have developed,” he said. He also criticised family politics of the Congress. “Where there is the Congress, all roads that lead to development are blocked. There is only family politics, corruption and lack of harmony,” said Modi.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah engaged in a war of words, with Modi mocking Siddaramaiah's decision to contest from two seats as the Kannada version of Congress' family politics.

Volcker report and after India is giving it too much importance,"INDIA takes the UN too seriously, more than most countries of the world do. We have done it in the past and suffered for it. An item in the agenda of the Security Council, created by us, hangs around our neck even today. We suffer pangs of conscience that we cannot subscribe to the NPT and the CTBT. And now we have thrown our own Ministry of External Affairs out of gear at a crucial moment by divesting an experienced, active and trusted minister, with an unblemished record of integrity, of his portfolio just because his name appeared on a piece of paper that bore the insignia of the UN. It did not matter what the source of the allegation was or whether the allegation was investigated at all. Even Shashi Tharoor’s assertion that there was no presumption of guilt in the report did not suffice to correct our exaggerated sense of sanctity of the UN and its reports. The Volcker report is not even a UN report. The committee was appointed not to look into the misdeeds of Saddam Hussein or his supporters, but to look into the reports of corruption and mismanagement in the UN itself. The Secretary-General faced grave charges of not only tolerating mismanagement of the Oil-for-Food programme, but also of shielding his son, who had exploited his father’s name to make profits for his company, if not for himself. A casual internal investigation he ordered exonerated everyone, but the whistle blowers persisted and the result was the appointment of Mr Paul Volcker, the grand old man, who had a reputation to have the determination of a Solomon come to justice. He submitted three interim reports at a cost exceeding $ 40 million, in which he castigated the Secretary-General and his son. The programme itself, which had been praised by the Security Council till it was wound up following the regime change in Iraq, was characterised as a compact with the devil. An unprecedented humanitarian effort was condemned as an inhuman scheme to line the pockets of the UN and Iraqi bureaucracies. Saddam Hussein was shown as a master-manipulator, who, even in the midst of making bombs and resisting his enemies, distributed oil and money to his friends abroad. The UN building reeked of putrid oil. The Volcker report went beyond the UN bureaucracy with its oil paint and left other black faces on its path. Among them were the permanent members of the Security Council themselves, who happily approved of deal after deal without any meaningful scrutiny. At the same time, they ensured that their own firms got as many contracts as possible, by edging out firms from other countries by virtue of their veto. Saddam, of course, was the arch-villain, but the Secretariat, including its oversight services, the General Assembly, the Security Council, the agents and the companies were guilty in different degrees, according to the Volcker report. The Indian Minister and the Congress party were consigned to the annexes without any investigation in the final report, which merely wrapped up the investigation. The final report was not even debated in the Security Council. The debates and action on the serious charges in the earlier reports were calibrated as, unlike India, the rest of the world did not take the report as gospel truth. The Secretary-General, who publicly accepted responsibility for the deeply embarrassing criticism of the Secretariat that there was “maladministration and evidence of corruption”, remained the Secretary-General on the strength of his continuing political support. Though the committee said it was not exoneration, the “not proven finding” was considered adequate to save the remaining term of the Secretary-General. Nothing further was heard of Mr Kojo Annan, who must be still digging for gold in Africa for his Western masters. The permanent members went for cover by arguing that they were too busy with other matters at that time to bother about oil or food. One even said that it was, after all, not UN money, which was mismanaged! The only heads that rolled were those of a few UN officials, notable among them Mr Benon Sevan, an ebullient Armenian from Cyprus, who was very popular till recently, with an impressive record of service in several hot spots. He was nearly hanged with Najeebullah in Afghanistan and he saw the UN chief in Iraq blowing up in front of him. The praise showered on him for performing the impossible task of managing the Oil-for-Food programme was soon forgotten and he was handed over to the authorities, stripped of his diplomatic immunities and privileges. The same thing happened to a few others. The report was used by each member of the UN to push his own agenda for reform and Mr Volcker was all set to wind up and leave. Neither the government nor the media in India took any great interest in the Volcker report. Our delegation did not seek to intervene in the Security Council debate even to deplore the sad state of affairs that the report had unearthed. But the moment the names of the minister and the Congress party were found in an obscure annexe to the final report, Mr Volcker assumed a larger-than-life image and all hell broke loose. The only action required on the part of the government was to ask its ambassador in the UN to seek the documents from Mr Volcker and see if there was any basis for the allegations. Instead, the minister himself protested too much and ignited the fire of indignation among his enemies across party lines. He poured oil onto the fire that was burning on account of the nuclear deal and the Vienna vote. And in the process of defending himself, he cast aspersions on the very policy he was responsible for. The leftists, who had attacked him for his policy just the other day, came to his rescue and the Opposition had a bonanza. In the ensuing confusion, the least that the Prime Minister could do was to move him out of the External Affairs Ministry till he was proved innocent of the allegation, while proclaiming that he was not guilty. If the Volcker report was treated the same way as the UN itself had treated it, we would still have had a minister to defend the policy he helped to shape. The Ministry of External Affairs has only itself to blame for giving the UN a larger-than-life image. It spent its time and resources in the last few months on a quest for permanent membership of the Security Council as though that would usher in an era of prosperity and prestige for India. Support to our candidature became the be-all and end-all of our bilateral diplomacy. Visiting dignitaries were goaded to sign on the dotted line to establish our credentials. If the UN was such a desirable prize, how could we have taken lightly a report of that very UN? It is said of the bureaucracy that it is like a chicken coop. The moment a little chick is hurt in the least, the others will pounce upon him and peck him to death. This is as true of South Block as the rest of the officialdom. Long service of great benefit to the nation is forgotten in a moment when a case involving a few dollars comes to light. The disciplining authorities have no knowledge of the substantive part of an officer’s contribution. In fact, they are not supposed to consider it at all while meting out justice for petty crimes. Ministers seem no exception. If a person is worthy of the nation’s confidence to be the External Affairs Minister of India, surely, he should be trusted to carry on his work till he is proved guilty of misdemeanour. We should have treated the Volcker report as the UN itself has treated it, not as the last word on crime and punishment, but as a harsh light flashed on some unsightly corners that needed attention. Punish those who have been proved guilty, but do not allow aspersions to undermine the institution itself. The writer is a former ambassador with extensive experience of the UN in New York, Nairobi and Vienna.","The article criticizes India for taking the UN too seriously, particularly in its response to the Volcker report on the Oil-for-Food program. It argues that India's Ministry of External Affairs overreacted by divesting a minister of his portfolio based on unproven allegations in the report. The author contends that the government's exaggerated sense of the sanctity of the UN and its failure to investigate the allegations properly led to unnecessary controversy.

Don’t need advice from NGOs on Tiger Reserve issue: Goa Minister,"A day after his opposition to setting up a Tiger Reserve in Goa went viral, state Forest Minister Vishwajit Rane on Friday said he “does not need advice” from NGOs over wildlife related issues, while also sarcastically taking potshots at trolls, who criticised his statement on social media. “Many times people take one statement and they try to turn and twist it around without even understanding. A lot of these people who make these statements, you should go back and check their overall contribution to the state of Goa,” Rane said in a video message on Saturday. “I want to ask these environmentalists. How many times have you read a statement or a study to tell us how forest management has to take place? I am going to do this very professionally. I don’t require environmentalists or NGOS to come and advise me,” Rane said, adding that he would be hiring retired forest officials from across the state for wildlife area management in the coastal state. Despite repeated sightings of tigers in the coastal state, Rane on Friday had said that there was no Tiger Reserve needed in Goa because the tigers sighted in the state were not resident tigers, but ones which crossed over into Goa from Karnataka. The statement had attracted a lot of criticism from environmentalists as well as social media users. Rane, a self-confessed wildlife photographer, in his video message on Saturday also continued in the same vein, adding that Goa was too small a state to have a Tiger Reserve of its own. “If somebody thinks I am going to be disheartened or I am going to move aside from my existing agenda, no I am not. I definitely do not think a tiger reserve is required for Goa. Tiger reserve is something meant for larger states because there are other complexities involved in this. There is no proposal as of now on my table or in Goa to make any kind of tiger Reserve. I am very firm,” Rane said.","Goa's Forest Minister Vishwajit Rane has expressed his opposition to establishing a Tiger Reserve in the state, arguing that Goa is too small and there are no resident tigers.

Power remains a laggard. Heavy engineering and hydrocarbon segments clocked strong growth, helped by renewed buoyancy in the oil and gas business, and focus on clean fuels. As the chart above shows, the performance comfortably places L&T to meet its full-year order inflow growth guidance of 10-12% and 12-15% growth in revenues (growth in first half is much higher). Even so, the management remains cautious pointing to lumpiness in order inflows and volatility in the market. The caution underscores the uncertain times. Investments by the private sector are yet to take off in a major way. While the government’s thrust on infrastructure development is driving the momentum in the domestic market, sustainability remains a question mark.The fear is clearances and fund allocations may take a back seat in an election year (towards the end of the fourth quarter), slowing the business momentum. These concerns have weighed on the L&T stock. Despite the company announcing a share buyback, and a strategy rethink to exit non-core businesses and focus on returns improvement, the stock hasn’t been a very strong outperformer. Sustainability of the momentum in execution and government-led investment remain key.","Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) reported strong earnings for the September quarter, with revenue up 21% and operating earnings and net profit growing at a faster pace. Order inflows increased by 46%, driven by the domestic market, particularly the public sector. Infrastructure division led growth, while power lagged behind. Despite the positive performance, management remains cautious due to uncertainty in private sector investments and potential slowdown in government spending ahead of elections. The company's stock performance has been modest despite share buyback and strategic shifts to improve returns. The sustainability of execution momentum and government-led investments will be crucial for future performance.",Business and Finance,2018-11-01 00:00:00
"Abhijit Bhattacharyya | Beijing bully runs berserk: Taiwan today, India next?","The recent 24-hour whirlwind visit to Taiwan by Ms Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, has exposed like nothing else the extent to which the dictatorial regime running the People’s Republic of China can go with its bullying tactics at home and abroad and the fury with which it can lash out when democratic nations refuse to fall in line with their diktats. Like all bullies everywhere, Beijing’s Communist overlord and his cohort resort to juvenile-like tactics, honking and prancing to establish their self-proclaimed sense of importance and to draw the world’s attention with an endless list of unilateral, utopian demands. As it has on past occasions, the bully’s familiar path follows the craft of turning its formidable backyard problems into an external opportunity to save their power through fist-pumping, missile-firing and reckless aerial fighter sorties around Taiwan. The crazy tactics of the Communist Party of China’s “core” comrade is a desperate bid to create a fear psychosis for all existing and potential adversaries, hoping to compel them stay away from the bully’s path. All this is with one aim: to save the emperor’s own skin from the stigma of chronic failure, at least on home ground, after its threats and warnings proved to have little effect. The ruling caucus of the CPC and its privately-owned military wing, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and its naval and air wings, have been past masters in bloodshed as it tries its histrionics with “live-war games” in the seas off Taiwan. The CPC-PLA drama had begun seven decades ago, as dictator Mao Zedong had masterminded the October 1950 trampling of Tibet on the sly while Beijing was all at sea in the 1950-1953 Korean War front. The bloody war in Beijing’s north-eastern neighbourhood goaded Mao to change tack to show a “spectacular victory” to the home audience in the opposite direction; the extreme south-west terrain of independent Tibet where India always had an enduring relationship with Lhasa, owing to geographical proximity, cultural affinity, religious fraternity, mutual reciprocity and commercial connectivity. In contrast, to Tibet, China’s Hwang Ho Hans were alien, unfriendly strangers with no commonality. What began in 1950 subsequently became a familiar pattern, leading to routine and repetitive acts. Thus, when Mao’s absurd theories and ideas led to the 1958-1962 Great Chinese Famine, killing 30-55 million across the countryside, the Han dictator engineered another crisis, far from the mass graveyard of mainland China. The dictator began an unprovoked, naked invasion of India in October 1962, permanently damaging the honour, image and self-respect of a somewhat gullible India, that failed to stand up to the Beijing bully. This assault strengthened Mao’s powers as, despite the famine and starvation deaths, the Chinese people saw their “Great Comrade-in-Chief” lead them to “victory” over India. Mao reigned unchallenged till his death in September 1976. These are age-old tricks of dictators, across continents. Whenever and wherever there’s the slightest internal trouble, an external “situation”, however tiny or innocuous, can be magnified for bloodshed as a “foreign bogey” always unites the ignorant, illiterate, ideologically blind masses who invariably tend to defend the indefensible but “victorious” dictators. This is exactly the play that CPC-PLA supremo Xi Jinping made earlier this month over Ms Pelosi’s visit, trying to imply that the world wouldn’t see tomorrow’s sunrise if it did not give in to his wishes. Unfortunately, however, the feisty US Speaker called his bluff. Though his third-term presidency is all but guaranteed, Emperor Xi is nevertheless facing a lot of internal adversity with the once-in-five-years CPC congress looming in November 2022. Xi is desperate to cast himself as the immortal hero in the epic of China’s national journey, at par with Mao. The Wuhan-origin Covid-19 pandemic has turned things upside down around the globe, the CPC’s multi-billion-dollar trans-continental projects are losing steam in all but a few geostrategic locations. For the beleagured Xi, aggression is no longer a choice, but a compulsion. Simply put, the unprovoked firing of a flurry of ballistic missiles not only into Taiwan’s territorial waters but also into Japan’s exclusive economic zone may look like the sign of an ascendant superpower, but really it is the opposite. China isn’t a rising state at this point, only a peaking power that has managed to endow itself with coercive capability, supplemented by soaring ambition; but all heading towards worsening challenges at home and abroad. So, expect more violence and erratic behaviour from a desperate President Xi and his CPC-PLA, whose “unstoppable chariot journey” is facing increasing intercontinental hurdles. Did Xi over-reach on Taiwan? Such questions are going to be asked at November’s CPC congress. For the first time since becoming President, Xi has turned from being the “hunter to the hunted” (like the Hindi song Shikari khud shikar ho gaya). Back home in America, meanwhile, Ms Pelosi has burnished her credentials as the “iron lady” in the mould of Indira Gandhi or Margaret Thatcher, standing up to the bully of Beijing and possibly establishing her legacy for the future, as President Joe Biden cuts an increasingly sorry figure, furthering doubts whether he will at all seek a second term. For some time to come, Taiwan will be the Middle Kingdom’s highest-value target. The deep penetration airspace violations, the attacks on fisheries, the sinking of small (armed or unarmed) boats, sanctions-type acts aimed at Taiwan’s trade and commerce, the electronic media’s psy-war propaganda operations and, at an entirely different level, the high-visibility deployment of aircraft-carrier task force to the South China Sea are all in offing. The whole water body spanning Southeast Asia, Australia and Japan will be far, far choppier. The CPC-PLA will increasingly resort to “sanctions” on the weak, the vulnerable and the defiant. The way the West has been doing to all and sundry till now. Moscow learnt this trick quickly in the past six months. It is now Xi’s turn to take a muscular course and try to call the shots. While it may be Taiwan today, tomorrow it is bound to be India. China has never ruled Taiwan; yet it claims ownership of the small island off its mainland. The same formula and absurdity lie ahead for Bharat, so don’t say that you were not warned. The bomb-brandishing bully of Beijing will soon be heading for the Indian border again.","The recent visit by US Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan highlights China's aggressive tactics, aimed at asserting control. Historically, China has used external aggression to divert attention from internal crises. President Xi Jinping's recent actions, such as firing missiles near Taiwan and Japan, reflect his desperation to project strength amid domestic challenges. However, these actions may backfire, especially as Xi faces internal opposition within the Communist Party of China. The upcoming CPC congress will likely scrutinize his foreign policy, including his approach to Taiwan. Despite China's attempts to dominate, its actions risk undermining its global standing and escalating tensions with nations like India. The international community must unite in opposing Chinese aggression, particularly as Taiwan remains a focal point. Other nations, including India, must be prepared to defend their sovereignty against Chinese threats.",Opinion and Editorial,2022-08-13 00:00:00
Pros and cons of using underground water needs proper research : Experts,"Many experts have pointed out that it is important to analyse and understand any potential future implications before initiating any project for mass scale utilisation of under-ground water in Manipur. The experts are of the opinion that the officials need to deliberate in minute details and conduct necessary surveys regarding the attempt by the State Government to dig tube well using solar power and use underground water for irrigation purposes. Speaking to The Sangai Express, Joint Director of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Imphal Centre, Dr I Meghachandra said that till date, underground water has not been properly tapped in Manipur and this water resource is still untouched. However, this water resource will be totally di- fferent from those found in States like Haryana and Punjab, he explained. The Joint Director opined that even though Manipur has ample amount of underground water, it will be the most logical and economically viable option to harvesting rain water instead of letting it go waste. On the other hand, Public Health Engineering Department Geophysicist Keisham Rajen conveyed that the underground water present in various locations of the State are all different when it comes to their depth as well as their purity. Various factors need to be researched and analysed minutely. Like for how long a well, if dug, will be able to give water or identifying which area will ensure that the wells never dry up etc, he said, adding that if underground water is har- vested from a proper source, then it will also provide immense benefits to the people. Agriculture Department Agri Officer (Hqs) AK Chittaranjan opined that if a particular well needs time to recharge its water after it has been used up, then it will not be economical in the long run. It is also necessary to find out how deep the aquifers are and where they are located, he informed. Chittaranjan further explained that it is important to analyse if there would be any far reaching implication of using underground water and added that if the underground water gets exhausted, then the locations on the surface where water are collected will also start drying up. Speaking to this paper, Manipur University Earth Science Department, Seismological Observatory scientist Dr S Manichandra said that the valley region of the State has ample amount of underground water with some areas having this water resource at a depth of around 10-15 feet while others have water at a depth of around 30-40 feet. The quality and properties of the underground water will differ from location to location. These underground water sources are often recharged from Kalapahar and Koubru Leikha, he informed. Directorate of Environment and Climate Change Deputy Director Dr T Brajakumar said that recharging of underground water reserves take a lot of time and the amount of such water reserve is directly proportionate to the amount of moisture in the soil and its fertility. If the water reserves dry up, then the soil moisture and fertility will decrease drastically, the water on the surface will also start disappearing, he said, stressing on the need to ensure proper harvesting of rain water instead. On the other hand, it may be mentioned that the Central Ground Water Board had intimated the State Government through a report claiming that Manipur has a large reserve of underground water which can be used for irrigation purposes.","Experts in Manipur have cautioned against the mass-scale utilization of underground water without thorough analysis of potential implications. They suggest that underground water in Manipur, although abundant, differs from that in other states and needs careful assessment before large-scale extraction. They emphasize the need to harvest rainwater instead of solely relying on underground water. Factors such as recharge time, depth, and purity of underground water vary across locations and must be considered. Proper utilization of underground water can benefit the people, but its depletion could lead to drying up of surface water sources. The Central Ground Water Board has highlighted Manipur's significant underground water reserves, suitable for irrigation.",Environment,2020-02-03 00:00:00
"Jaitley, the wingman","The ex-Finance Minister may not be in govt but the BJP still needs his expertise and management skills With the halo around Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the penumbra dominated by BJP party chief Amit Shah, rarely does one talk about the man who is as much a Modi-maker, having steered him through the legalities of the Gujarat riots and crafted the personality phenomenon across the intelligentsia to make him the pan-India brand he has become today. That man is former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Even though he has opted out of the new government on health grounds, he has been a ferocious warrior of the Modi brigade through these painful months, defending the government’s policies and blunting the edge of the Opposition attack through his blogs and brief appearances. Even at the risk of his own electoral fortunes, where he failed ultimately, he has never faulted on his primary job, that of being Modi’s most efficacious counter-critic. And if the discontent over demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) failed to dampen the BJP’s electoral prospects this Lok Sabha election, then Jaitley needs to be thanked in good measure for neutralising people’s fears and anxieties and keeping them corked till the winds cleared. He has even managed to defend the indefensible and turned it into a fine art, simply by statistical comparisons, like apportioning the blame of public banks piling up non-performing assets (NPAs) to the UPA regime between 2008 and 14 and diverting attention from why NDA2 allowed it to fester and let two violators, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, escape. He diluted the rising angst of joblessness by rolling out international projections of India’s healthy growth rate and its cascading effect on job-creating sectors. If there were doubts about figures put out by think tanks, he found holes in their methodology. Point is nobody could have been a better propagandist and perhaps this is why Modi drove to his residence and is considering a way for Jaitley to still stay relevant. So though he may stay away from the Ministry, his advisory role in the new government cannot be ruled out. Jaitley’s biggest challenge has been to ensure an almost impossible consensus across party lines for GST. Had it not been for his gentle persuasion, a common tax structure would have been impossible. In fact, more than an economic tool, GST stands out as a shining example of bipartisan politics in NDA2, which has mostly been accused of undermining institutions and being bull-headed about dissent. For the record, the consensus was unanimous, there was never a need for voting! Though conceived by the Congress regime, Jaitley will always be remembered as the man who converted a theory into practice in real time. He was equally proactive about taking on the challenges posed by the implementation of GST. Now that the collections have stabilised, it doesn’t seem to be such a bad thing. And for all her fury towards Modi, even Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee had amiable terms with Jaitley, he attending the Bengal investors’ meet on receiving her invitation. Though both demonetisation and GST were policy disruptors, with catastrophic short-term squeeze on the economy, he still bet on their long-term impacts, fully aware that this would dent the Modi government’s appeal among the masses. Yet he did not let tapering economic growth figures daunt him and despite them, ushered in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to perk up the banking sector. He has worked out a slew of measures for attracting foreign investment, lowered corporate tax rate for MSMEs, turning them into a vital engine of economic growth, and at a time of extreme farm distress, promised a minimum 50 per cent return over production cost to farmers besides laying the template for direct cash transfers. He has eased foreign direct investment. In fact, the Micro Units Development Refinance Agency (MUDRA) Bank, that has given a fillip to micro-entrepreneurship, is probably one of the key reasons, besides the Prime Minister’s Awas Yojana, why the electorate in the rural hinterland kept the faith in the BJP. And even though he couldn’t present the vote-on-account, he had realised the political expediency of sending the right message and authored the Rs 6,000 per year income support scheme to farmers with small land-holdings. So though he may not be part of NDA3, Modi may continue to count on him as his wingman for some time.","The article praises Arun Jaitley for his role in the BJP and his effectiveness as a counter-critic for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It highlights his contributions, including defending the government's policies, neutralizing fears over demonetization and GST, and managing public perception. The article acknowledges Jaitley's role in securing a consensus for GST, describing it as a shining example of bipartisan politics. It credits him with steering through economic challenges, introducing the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and implementing measures to attract foreign investment. The author suggests that Jaitley may continue to play an advisory role in the new government, despite his health concerns.",Politics,2019-05-31 00:00:00
CM offers sops to various panchayats,"With lok Sabha elections round the corner, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav offered sops to the members of various panchayat bodies by increasing their honorarium and promising better work culture in the three-tier system. The honorarium of gram pradhans has been increased to Rs 2,500 per month from the existing Rs 700. The block pramukhs will get Rs 7,000 and zila panchayat chiefs Rs 10,000 monthly honorarium. Besides, the BDC members will get Rs 500 per day for the meetings and the district panchayat members a daily allowance of Rs 1,000. “The Samajwadi Party believes in democracy. It (democracy) can only be strengthened through a strong Panchayati Raj system. Therefore, our Government has taken a decision to increase the honorarium of members of panchayat bodies,” the Chief Minister announced at a function held in Saifai on Monday. “The state will progress only if villages become prosperous. The gram panchayats are the backbone of democracy and we cannot ignore them Until we strengthen the gram panchayats economically we cannot think about the progress of villages,” the Chief Minister said in the function attended by over 20,000 representatives of panchayats and co-operative bodies. The Chief Minister said the state was marching on the path of progress. “It is true that Uttar Pradesh is facing power crisis. The problem will be solved by 2014 when power projects in lalitpur and Allahabad will become operational,” he said. Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav, who was also present at the function, said that it had come to his notice that some officers were not performing their duties diligently. He said the Chief Minister should identify such officers and take action against them. “Action should also be taken against erring district magistrates and district police chiefs,” he added. Talking about politics, Yadav Senior said that no party could ignore the Samajwadi Party post-lok Sabha election. He said a new political dispensation would be possible only with the support of the SP. “People have already rejected Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party. The only option before them is a Third Front,” he said. Exhorting the representatives of panchayats, Yadav Sr. asked them to identify their might because they had the power to change the fortune of the country. “Think positively and unitedly about your goal because you play a decisive role in the victory of a candidate,” he added. The SP supremo also asked the state ministers and senior leaders of the party to go to people and build rapport with them. “If a leader loses contact with masses it is end of his or her political career,” he said.","Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav increased the honorarium for panchayat members, raising gram pradhans' monthly pay from Rs 700 to Rs 2,500, block pramukhs to Rs 7,000, and zila panchayat chiefs to Rs 10,000.

Amazon patents new Alexa feature that knows when you're ill and offers you medicine,"Amazon has patented a new version of its virtual assistant Alexa which can automatically detect when you’re ill and offer to sell you medicine. The proposed feature would analyse speech and identify other signs of illness or emotion. One example given in the patent is a woman coughing and sniffling while she speaks to her Amazon Echo device. Alexa first suggests some chicken soup to cure her cold, and then offers to order cough drops on Amazon. If Amazon were to introduce this technology, it could compete with a service planned by the NHS. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said earlier this year that the NHS was working on making information from its NHS Choices online service available through Alexa. Amazon’s system, however, doesn’t need to ask people whether they’re ill - it would just know automatically by analysing their speech. Amazon's new patent filing shows an Amazon Echo device which knows when you're ill. Adverts for sore throat products could be automatically played to people who sound like they have a sore throat, Amazon’s patent suggests. The patent filing also covers the tracking of emotions using Alexa. Amazon describes a system where Alexa can tell by your voice if you’re feeling bored and tired, and then it would suggest things to do for those moods. This futuristic version of Alexa would listen out for if users are crying and then class them as experiencing an “emotional abnormality.” Amazon also described a way of targeting adverts towards different moods. The patent filing includes a scenario where a singer paid for adverts on Alexa for their new album which would only be played to tired or bored people. Amazon’s patent filing does not definitively prove that the company is working on any of the features described, however. Technology companies file many patents, including for aborted products and ideas that will never get past the drawing board. Healthcare and medicine is an area that Amazon has been focusing on in recent years. In June, the company announced that it had purchased Pillpack, a US business which sends prescriptions in the post.","Amazon has patented a new version of its virtual assistant Alexa that can detect when users are ill by analyzing their speech patterns and emotional cues. The proposed feature could automatically suggest remedies like chicken soup or offer to order medicine such as cough drops from Amazon. This development could potentially compete with healthcare services like the NHS's plans to provide health information through Alexa. While the patent filing outlines advanced capabilities to track emotions and tailor advertisements accordingly, it doesn't confirm Amazon's definite implementation of these features. Amazon has been increasingly involved in healthcare, evident from its acquisition of Pillpack, a company specializing in prescription delivery.",Technology and Gadgets,2018-10-09 00:00:00
DNA TV Show: What role does politics play in Tirupati laddoo row? Is this battle for ownership of temple trust?,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, on Wednesday, alleged that substandard ingredients and animal fat were used in making the Tirupati laddu, a consecrated sweet, during the previous YSRCP government. Ever since then, the whole country has been intrigued to know who is the great sinner of Tirupati Balaji temple. After all, on whose orders was ghee containing animal fat being supplied to Tirupati Balaji temple? After all, who played with the faith of crores of Hindus for their benefit? Today, we will expose the deceit done to Tirupati Balaji and his devotees. We will make such revelations related to the biggest conspiracy to corrupt the religion of Hindus, which will blow your mind. Before moving forward on those revelations, we want to tell you the timeline of this great sin. In June 2024, Chandrababu Naidu defeated Jagan Mohan Reddy and took power in Andhra Pradesh. After the complaints, on July 9, the temple board sent samples of ghee to the NDDB lab. On July 16, the lab report revealed that the ghee of was adulterated. A meeting of the temple trust was held on July 22. On July 23, the samples of ghee were again sent for thorough investigation. The report of this sample came on September 18. The report expressed suspicion of animal fat being mixed inside the ghee. That is, in Tirupati Devasthanam, animal fat was being fed in the name of Prasadam. What could be a bigger fraud with Hindus than this? Before the report came, the people of the trust had doubts about the poor quality of the Prasadam, but they could not raise their voices because they were under pressure. The question is who were those people on whose orders fat was mixed in the Prasadam? ""Fat in Tirupati Prasad is the biggest example of corruption in temples. Just think that now the Hindus of the country can't even trust the temples. Those who are responsible for the temples are feeding the devotees animal fat. When the devotees of Tirupati touch the Prasad with their foreheads at that time the suppliers of fat must be laughing demonically. They must be thinking that look this fool is looking for divinity in the fat of a dead animal. This is what has happened with more than 3 crore devotees who visit Tirupati every year,"" TDP leader Anam Venkata Ramana Reddy said. Union minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh also demanded that those allegedly involved in using “beef tallow, lard (pig fat), and fish oil” in the ghee for preparing Tirupati laddoo “should be hanged,” not just punished. The adulteration of Tirupati Balaji temple's prasad is part of a larger game of corruption. Animal fat was added not only to insult Hinduism but also out of greed. This game started when milk prices rose in Andhra Pradesh. For the last 5 decades, Karnataka Cooperative Milk Federation has been supplying pure desi ghee to Tirupati Trust. When milk prices increased, in July 2023, KMF refused to supply ghee at a lower rate. KMF used to supply the famous Nandini ghee to the temple trust. The then Jagan Mohan Reddy government terminated KMF's contract. The tender for ghee was given to the 5 firms with the lowest bid. However, complaints kept coming regarding the ghee of the new firms. A political controversy also arose regarding this in August last year. In August 2023, KMF President Bhima Naik alleged that the temple trust was buying low-quality ghee. AV Dharma Reddy, the then officer of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam Trust, rejected the allegations and cited the e-tender process. However, nothing was said about the quality of the ghee then. Everyone knew that the quality of the ghee had deteriorated, and due to this the taste and quality of the laddoos had been affected. The trust of Tirupati Balaji temple buys 5 lakh kg of ghee every year. Every day 1 to 1.5 lakh laddoos are prepared. From this, you can understand how much ghee is used. It is also certain that due to the rising prices of milk, the prices of ghee would have also increased. It is doubtful that instead of KMF, the firms bidding less may be able to provide unadulterated ghee. When the samples were found to be faulty in July, the Chandrababu Naidu government again gave the tender for the supply of Nandini Ghee to KMF on August 29. This means that the purity of the laddoos available in Tirupati at present can be trusted. The news of animal fat in Tirupati Prasad has shocked crores of Hindus. There has been a conspiracy to lead religion astray in the places that are the flag bearers of religion. Sadhus and saints across the country are filled with anger over this. The harshest punishment is being demanded for those who conspired to adulterate ghee with animal fat. Not only this, religious gurus are demanding to take the Tirupati Temple Trust out of government control.","Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu recently accused the previous YSRCP government of using substandard ingredients and animal fat in the making of the Tirupati laddu. Following allegations of adulterated ghee, samples were tested, revealing contamination. The issue escalated into a political controversy, with calls for severe punishment for those involved. The situation prompted the Chandrababu Naidu government to reinstate the supply of pure Nandini ghee from Karnataka Cooperative Milk Federation, ensuring the quality of the revered laddu, and sparking outrage among devotees and religious leaders who demand stricter oversight of temple trusts.",Politics,2024-09-20 00:00:00

"Spend 1 hour every Sunday to clean surroundings, upload pics on NaMo & Saral apps: Paatil to Surat leaders","State BJP president C R Paatil on Friday appealed to party leaders and workers to spend one hour on every Sunday to clean their surroundings and upload photographs of the same on NaMo and Saral apps. This will help Surat, which is currently the second most cleanest city in India, to reach the first position in the Swachha Bharat Survekshan, he added. Paatil was speaking at the Nutan Varsh Sneh Milan event at Udhna in Surat. Addressing the gathering, Paatil said, “I am regularly scolded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on why Surat bagged the second position and not the first in the cleanest city list. I have told Surat city BJP president Niranjan Janjmera to instruct elected councilors to work on cleanliness of their own wards. Each ward consists of four councilors and areas should be divided equally among them.”“From next month, between 8 am and 9 am every Sunday, BJP leaders and workers should clean localities, alongwith civic body staffers. The councilors should upload photographs of such work on NaMo and Saral apps. If this work is done regularly, we will definitely bag the first position among cleanest cities,” he added.Paatil also appealed to BJP leaders to watch Mann Ki Baat programme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi every month at the house of a person in their wards. “There should be a gathering of 15 to 50 people. Take photos of such gatherings and upload them on NaMo and Saral apps. This will help local leaders grow in popularity.”On elected BJP leaders being appointed as mayors, deputy mayors, standing committee chairpersons, ruling party leaders and chairpersons of committees in municipal corporations as well as district and talukapanchayats, Paatil said the party has come up with a formula on appointing leaders on key posts. “Leaders who have failed to get votes in their own wards have not been given such key posts… There were some who were using influence, but we remained firm on following the new formula. If a leader is not accepted in his own ward, how come he becomes the leader of the city,” he asked.Lauding the party’s page committee members, who have the responsibility to ensure that voters reach polling booths during elections, Paatil said: “Prior to the 2022 Assembly elections, I have announced that BJP will win all 182 seats, but we won 156…. The credit of this achievement goes to page committee workers… Big shot leaders of Congress lost seats… some of them, who were initially winning, lost…”In a dig at BJP MLA from Udhna, Manu Patel, who was present at the event, Paatil said: “Manubhai had earlier lost the municipal election and now he won (state polls) by 70,000 votes. The victory is not of the leader, the credit goes to page committee members. I want to advise Patel to be aggressive with officials and not with party workers. We will not tolerate such insults…” “However, since last one year, I have not come across a single complaint against Patel,” he added.","State BJP president C R Paatil has urged party leaders and workers in Surat to spend one hour every Sunday cleaning their surroundings and upload photographs of the same on NaMo and Saral apps. This initiative is aimed at helping Surat reach the first position in the Swachha Bharat Survekshan, as it currently holds the second position. Paatil emphasized the importance of regular efforts to enhance cleanliness in the city, and he urged elected councilors to actively participate in the initiative. He believes that by collectively working towards cleanliness, Surat can secure the top spot among the cleanest cities in India.",Politics,2023-11-25 00:00:00

Home min’s intervention sought in alleged murder case,"The Likha Welfare Society (LWS) on Tuesday sought the home minister’s intervention in the alleged murder of Likha Taje by a miscreant in Doimukh on 10 July. A case has been registered at the Doimukh police station under Section 302 IPC. In its representation to the home minister, the LWS stated that the father of the deceased had disclosed the name of the murderer at the time of lodging the FIR. “However, even after the passing of 20 days, there is no sign of substantial progress in the investigation,” it said. It said the investigating authority was unable to collect the call details record and the location of the mobile phone, as well as the voice recording of the alleged accused, who it said contacted the parents of the deceased about the incident. It also claimed that, while the alleged accused are giving contradictory statements about the incident to the police, one prime suspect accused has been granted bail by the sessions court in Yupia. Demanding the re-arrest of the alleged accused, the LWS said “since the investigation relates to an offence of murder, nine days’ police custody is mandatory, and the police should interrogate methodically all the suspected accused. “However,” it said, “one more prime accused has not been arrested by the police.” The LWS pleaded with the home minister to either have the case investigated by a special investigating team or recommend it to the Central Bureau of Investigation.","The Likha Welfare Society (LWS) has sought the intervention of the home minister in the alleged murder case of Likha Taje, which occurred in Doimukh on July 10.

A slowdown or recession?,"The problems are not confined to the rich or emerging markets but encompass the world. The RBI Governor, Raghuram Rajan, has very good credentials to talk about the state of the global economy. A former chief economist of the IMF, Dr. Rajan is among the very few who foresaw the great financial crisis of 2008 triggered by the collapse of the iconic investment bank Lehman Brothers. His performance at the RBI needs no major elucidation. Taking over the stewardship of the central bank at a difficult time, he managed to stabilise the macro-economy fairly quickly. All these as well as his academic credentials ensure that his views and comments on the global economy would be listened to with more than ordinary interest.

U-17 WOMEN’S FOOTBALL COACH FACES CHARGE OF ‘MISCONDUCT’,"An assistant coach of the India under-17 women’s football team readying for the World Cup this year has been suspended pending investigation after allegations of misconduct with a player surfaced during the team’s ongoing trip to Norway. The World Cup will be held in India from October 11-30. The coach, who is a former India player, has returned to Goa, and will be called before an internal disciplinary board of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), now under a committee of administrators (CoA), next week. AIFF officials, who asked not to be named, said that the issue came to light when the player, who is a minor, was not in her room for three successive nights. Manager Hilda Gurung and staff in the squad, coached by Swede Thomas Dennerby, searched rooms to see if she was with any other team mate. But she could not be traced. The assistant coach, too, said the player was not in her room, leading to a harried staff contemplating filing a missing person’s complaint. Not long after, however, the player was spotted leaving the assistant coach’s room. A PTI report said it was Dennerby who informed AIFF about the assistant coach’s behaviour. Given that this happened on a trip funded by the Union government, the Sports Authority of India, too, has been informed by CoA, PTI added State football associations, in a joint media release, have called for an FIR against the assistant coach on charges of serious misconduct with a minor, a life ban, and revoking his coaching badges. “An event of misconduct has been reported in the U-17 women’s team, currently on an exposure tour to Europe. The AIFF follows a zero-tolerance policy on indiscipline. As an initial action, the Federation has provisionally suspended the individual pending further investigation,” a statement from the CoA said on Thursday. “The AIFF has asked the concerned individual to stop all contact with the team… and be physically present for further investigations….” Following this charge of misconduct, state associations have also “resolved to request COA and AIFF Administration to urgently appoint a Woman Safety Officer with immediate effect.” This will instil confidence in the system for women players and women working in football especially with the national teams and in AIFF house, their statement said.“We will be probing all angles including serial misconduct,” said an AIFF official, asking not to be named.","An assistant coach of India's U-17 women's football team has been suspended after allegations of misconduct with a minor player during a trip in Norway.

Don’t forget growth in race to curb inflation,"Amid the ongoing fight against inflation, will the elevated interest rates cripple demand and lead the country to unacceptably low economic growth? That is a big concern hanging like the sword of Damocles. The fractured verdict by the RBI Monetary Policy Committee in hiking the interest rate has laid bare the conflicting views of the advisors and policymakers. Two external members of the MPC, who voted against the hike, cautioned that the excessive front-loading of rate hikes carries the risk of overshooting, while four other MPC members espoused the hike. Ashima Goyal, an MPC member and emeritus professor at Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, reckons that raising real policy rates to reduce demand has a stronger effect on growth than inflation. According to her, overshooting can have persistent deleterious effects, including instability. The other MPC member, Jayanth R Varma, professor of IIM-A, said a repo rate of 6.50% (the rate at which RBI lends money to commercial banks) would likely overshoot the policy rate needed to achieve price stability. In December, too, he had voted against a 0.35% hike. Central banks around the globe have an unenviable job of regulating the unusually flaring inflation amid fears of a recession. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das doesn’t rule out the uncertainty over inflation. He cites a string of triggers, such as geopolitical tensions, global financial market volatility, rising non-oil commodity prices, volatile crude oil prices, and weather-related events. But on February 8, the central bank hiked the benchmark interest rate for the sixth time in a row in the current tightening cycle, pushing the rate cumulatively by 2.5% in 10 months to 6.5%. This has made life difficult for the common person, with loan pricing shooting through the roof. Despite RBI’s continuous efforts, retail inflation accelerated to 6.52% in January, the highest in three months, way above its comfort zone of 4–6%. There are a few worrying points. For one, the rural inflation at 6.85% is way higher than the urban inflation of 6%. Two, several large states have recorded higher inflation than the national average. Incidentally, when almost every other segment showed an increase in prices, vegetables showed a negative growth of 11.70%, promising tough times for farmers and the rural economy. The global outlook may have complicated India’s fight against inflation. But we can’t afford to let a slowdown shave off our growth prospects for long.","The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) faces a challenging situation in balancing the fight against inflation with the need to maintain economic growth. The fractured verdict on the latest interest rate hike highlights the differing views among advisors and policymakers. Some MPC members caution that aggressive rate hikes could overshoot the mark, negatively impacting growth more than inflation and potentially causing instability. They suggest that the current repo rate of 6.50% might already be excessively restrictive for achieving price stability. Globally, central banks are navigating high inflation amid recession fears. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das acknowledges the uncertainties surrounding inflation, citing various global factors. In February 2023 (note: the article is from that period), the RBI had raised the benchmark interest rate for the sixth consecutive time, totaling a 2.5% increase in ten months, leading to higher loan costs for the public. Despite these efforts, retail inflation rose to 6.52% in January 2023, exceeding the RBI's comfort zone. Worryingly, rural inflation was significantly higher than urban inflation, and several large states experienced inflation above the national average. Additionally, vegetable prices showed a sharp decline, potentially harming farmers and the rural economy. While global factors complicate India's inflation fight, the article emphasizes the critical need to avoid a prolonged economic slowdown in the pursuit of price stability.",Business and Finance,2023-02-25 00:00:00

Sebi wants alternative investment funds raising money to hire investment banks,"The Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) wants all private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) funds raising money to hire investment banks - a proposal that fund houses are trying to push back. The regulator wants a third-party intermediary, governed by rules of the capital market, to verify information in a fund's 'private placement memorandum.' PPM is the key document prospective investors skim through before putting money in alternative investment funds (AIFs) - the regulatory term for PE and VC funds. The stand taken by Sebi follows large funds, running multiple schemes with thousands of crores of assets under management (AUM), submitting PPMs that are incomplete and often in violation of regulations. The issue was discussed and the lapses in applications by several AIFs were shared by Sebi officials this month with the Alternative Investment Policy Advisory Committee, headed by NR Narayana Murthy, two persons aware of the development told ET. Faster approvals ""For instance, one of the PPMs by a large fund said it would make temporary investments in instruments issued by entities in OECD countries,"" said a person present in the meeting. ""Another said it would give loans and guarantees, while (yet) another said it would allow indirect co-investments and extend the tenure of funds with the consent of the advisory committee. None of these are allowed under regulations... These applications did not come from small funds or newbies."" One of the PPMs talked about giving special rights to a select class of investors to extend the commitment period (during which a fund is allowed to call in capital from investors for making new investments). There are around 700 AIFs in India with more than Rs 4.5 lakh crore committed by investors. Sebi thinks that the presence of a merchant banker would help in reducing irregularities in PPM and quicken clearance of applications. But the regulator will have to dispel the fears that AIFs harbour. ET Bureau By Sugata Ghosh & Reena Zachariah, ET Bureau Last Updated: Jul 27, 2021, 10:21:00 AM IST Industry Flip side ""An AIF is far more bespoke a product, and expecting a merchant banker to oversee the fund documents is premised on the fact that they are expected to understand the nuance of the product as well as the fund entity itself, which may not be true,"" said Siddharth Shah, senior partner at law firm Khaitan & Co. ""Second, involving an intermediary will add to the cost of fundraising, which is already high in India compared to many other markets, besides adding to the complexity of the process. Lastly, forcing an involvement of a merchant banker and making them powerful could hamper product innovation as the intermediaries start dictating product offerings."" While AIFs should not lose their flexibility, Sebi, said a person aware of the discussions, is firm that there has to be a set of minimum set of disclosures for investors. ""It was pointed out that in some applications, the illustration of the 'waterfall' was missing. One of the PPMs did not make disclosures on 'related party' and 'warehousing' transactions,"" said the person. A 'waterfall' lays down how the fund would distribute capital to various investors as it books profits by selling underlying investments. ""Many of the violations were by large funds - such as 74 schemes and AUM of Rs 20,000 crore, 20 schemes managing Rs 14,000 crore, four schemes with Rs 7,000 crore, etc,"" he said. Sebi's recent move is unrelated to previous measures such as introducing a standardised PPM template and mandatory performance benchmarking by AIFs. According to Sebi officials, it is aimed at faster turnaround of approvals, said the person. Sebi is understood to be receiving 20-25 applications for fundraising from AIFs every month.","Sebi wants PE and VC funds to hire investment banks for fundraising. It aims to verify information in fund documents to reduce irregularities and speed up approvals. However, there are concerns that this could increase costs and complexity for AIFs.

"After 3 blasts, security tightened at Golden Temple","CHANDIGARH: Following a security scare after three low-intensity blasts rocked the area around the Golden Temple, 50 high-resolution CCTVs are being installed at the galliara around the complex and Heritage Street by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). It has been decided to install scanners at all the entrances to secure devotees and visitors. In another first, dedicated women personnel have been deployed to check the ladies. In addition, a giant LED screen has been set up that will flash multi-lingual ‘dos and don’ts’, besides the significance of the shrine and the maryada (tenets) that have to be observed in the complex. “This step has been taken after the recent low-intensity blasts around the golden temple,’’ said an SGPC official.

Schools on outskirts offer sops,"Printed from Schools on outskirts offer sops TNN | Jan 14, 2015, 02.10 AM IST NAGPUR: Things are looking tough for schools that are not among top brands and located 15-25 kms away from the city. Retaining current students and attracting new admissions are both getting tougher. Distance is the biggest impediment for such institutions as parents would rather send students as close as possible to home. Many schools have started offering sops to ensure their enrollment does not slide. A well-known higher education group, whose schools are not as popular, has started offering a discount in fee to already enrolled students. A source tells TOI parents have been told there would be no fee increase for them in 2015-16 academic session if they paid the entire fee in advance now. There are some which offer discount on sibling admissions while others give away free gifts such as school bags, compass box etc to woo new admissions. An academician who has a school both within and outside city limits said, “This is becoming a common practice for many schools located on the outskirts. It is not easy for them to maintain high enrollment numbers. The number of new schools cropping up is staggering and due to this, the less known ones struggle for enrollment.” A teacher from branded school said, “We too are parents and we understand that everyone wants that their children should get the best education. If we admit our kids in schools where we teach, either the entire fee is waived off or a 30-50% discount is given. If that were not so, we would have had to admit in a less known brand. In that case distance will be the criteria. Why send children 15 kms away when it is not a branded school?” While ‘brand’ with regards to schools may mean different things for different people, usually it is academic performance, infrastructure and being part of a national franchisee. Some schools and their specific branches thrive purely on academics even though they are constrained by infrastructure. For instance, Bhavan’s (Civil Lines), Modern (NEERI) and Somalwar (Ramdaspeth) may not have swimming pools or vast playground, yet they top the wish list of admission seekers and applications are oversubscribed many times over. Centre Point School group has a mix of both and that is its USP. Another academician said, “If it’s a branded school then traveling far is not an issue. Modern (Koradi), Jain International, Delhi Public School, Narayana Vidyalayam (Chinchbhuvan) etc are some schools that will attract students. But the going is getting tough for the less known brands. Also as income levels rise, each year parents aspire to put their kids in popular schools.” With the bigger schools now expanding to the outskirts, as CPS is doing with its new branch at Ensaara, there will be bigger worries for the second and third rung players.","In Nagpur, schools located 15-25 kms from the city struggle with declining enrollments compared to top brands. To counter this, many offer incentives like fee discounts, advance payment perks, and gifts for new admissions. Academics and infrastructure define school ""brand,"" with institutions like Bhavan’s and Modern leading despite limited facilities. Established names like Centre Point School thrive on mixed strengths. However, lesser-known schools face tougher competition and parental preference for proximity and reputation. As major schools expand to outskirts, challenges grow for smaller players. Rising incomes fuel aspirations for top schools, underscoring difficulties for others in maintaining enrollment.",National News,2015-01-14 00:00:00

Ashok Gulati remembers M S Swaminathan: He brought science and humanity together,"M S Swaminathan is no more. But his legacy remains with every student and scientist of agriculture. He is most widely known for working with Norman Borlaug to usher in the Green Revolution in India in the mid-1960s when India was facing back-to-back droughts. Millions would have died of starvation if the country had not experienced the Green Revolution. India was already termed as a “ship to mouth” economy, as the country was importing 10 million tonnes from the US under P.L.480 scheme. And India had no foreign exchange to pay for it. I can recall the days when the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri had given a call to the nation to “skip a meal in a week”, and how wheat products, including wheat chapatis, would not be served at wedding parties. It was at that time that Swaminathan worked hard to convince our political leadership to import 18,000 tonnes of seeds of high-yielding dwarf wheat varieties, Lerma Rojo and Sonora-64, from Mexico. This was the biggest seed shipment in history at that time. The seeds had to be indigenised to local conditions. With Kalyan Sona and Sonalika, the new indigenised wheat varieties, India changed its agriculture paradigm under Swaminathan’s leadership. It was so inspiring that many people in the country, including me, named their children after these wheat varieties. His contribution had a far-reaching impact. India experienced a wheat and rice revolution. This gave the country much-needed respite and confidence to turn the tables on food security in a short time. Who could believe that one day India will emerge as a significant exporter of cereals. In the last three years, 2020-21 to 2022-23, India exported 85 million tonnes of cereals contributing to global food security. Forty per cent of global exports of rice come from India. The seeds of this transformation were sown by Swaminathan and his team of Indian agri-scientists, working closely with Borlaug. They deserve all the credit and our gratitude. It is well known that Swaminathan was a geneticist as well as an administrator. He headed the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), and later became the Director General of the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. He was rightly awarded the first World Food Prize in 1987, which incidentally was set up by Norman Borlaug, who had received the Nobel Peace Prize, as there is no Nobel Prize for Agriculture. Borlaug then set up an institution to recognise contributions to agriculture – the World Food Prize is a product of his endeavours. No wonder Swaminathan, who worked with him most closely, was the first recipient of the World Food Prize. Swaminathan was also conferred the Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan for his outstanding contributions. He also received several other awards like the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award, Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award and the Indira Gandhi Prize. Listing them all here in this obituary is simply not possible. I had the privilege of visiting him at his home and sharing the dais with him on several occasions. One thing was clear: Even in his late 80s, Swaminathan was brimming with energy and inspired students and scientists alike. Most of them would surround him for selfies! And, he was always generous and smiling. The last time I saw him was perhaps in Pune, when he was wheelchair-bound and giving a power-point presentation to Sharad Pawar and Venkaiah Naidu. One could see the fire in his belly and his passion for agriculture. He was a hero who could bring science and humanity together. With his demise, an era has come to an end.","Challenge today is to continue Swaminathan's legacy, improve farmers' profitability during times of climate change",Miscellaneous,2023-09-29 00:00:00

England routs West Indies to sweep ODI series 3-0,"Late start, early finish. England needed just 30 of 40 available overs to beat the West Indies by seven wickets and achieve a 3-0 clean sweep of their one-day international series at the Oval on Tuesday. Jamie Smith's maiden ODI fifty, 64 of the 93-run opening stand in seven overs, launched England's successful assault on the rain-revised target of 246. The game was delayed twice, first because a traffic lights outage trapped the West Indies bus long enough so the team wasn't even at the ground at the scheduled toss, and secondly for a 90-minute rain break. Without a warmup in the nets, and forced to bat in gloomy bowler-friendly conditions, the West Indies slumped to 28-3 before the rain and 154-7 soon afterward. That it eventually racked up 251-9 was impressive. Sherfane Rutherford kept the innings alive with 70 off 71 balls, then teammates Gudakesh Motie and Alzarri Joseph, the Nos. 8 and 9 batters, gave their side a fighting chance with a partnership of 91 in 11.2 overs. In the highest ever eighth-wicket ODI stand by the West Indies against England, Motie and Joseph clobbered the host with five sixes and 10 boundaries. Joseph was out to a skier on 41 off 29, and Motie was bowled on the last ball on 63 off 54. Spinner Adil Rashid was the pick of the bowlers with 3-40. England players adapted to the pre-game traffic problems near the Oval by exiting their bus and hiring bicycles to get to the ground. Smith used more of that dynamic thinking on the fly to deflate West Indies hopes again on his home ground. Smith blasted 10 boundaries and three sixes before his off stump was bowled by Motie in the seventh over after scoring 64 from 28 deliveries. Smith scored at such a rate that England's 100 in the eight-over powerplay was the fourth fastest in ODIs, and its 121-1 after 10 overs was England's best-ever 10-over total. Ben Duckett propelled England further with 58 from 46, falling at 155-2 with the chase more than half over. The mopping up was left to Joe Root with a casual 44, and Jos Buttler's unbeaten 41. The teams play three Twenty20s from Friday, starting at Chester-le-Street.","England wrapped up a 3-0 clean sweep of their one-day international series against the West Indies, thanks to a convincing 7-wicket victory at the Oval.

His partnership with Ben Duckett, who scored 58 off 46 balls, laid the foundation for England's successful run chase. The West Indies had struggled to post a competitive total, slumping to 28-3 and 154-7, but a strong partnership between Gudakesh Motie and Alzarri Joseph helped them reach 251-9.

Looking back at July 2007,"Today we trade at a PE of 15, four quarters forward on 2009-10 earnings, which are expected to grow at 18 per cent, and GDP at 8 per cent, with confidence in both these numbers eroding with every passing week, writes Udayan Mukherjee. After the gut-wrenching fall of the last few weeks, there's a lot of surprise that value buying has still not emerged. After all, the Sensex has lost over 30 per cent from its all-time high. That is just one way of looking at it. The other way is that the clock has simply been turned back to July 2007, when the Sensex was at 14,900 as well. A mere eight months back. It is instructive to shed the baggage of 21,500 Sensex and examine whether things are so dramatically different from that period. The index was trading then at an 2008-09 PE- two quarters forward- of around 17 times. GDP growth was about to come in at above 9 per cent and earnings growth at 25 per cent. Today we trade at a PE of 15, four quarters forward on 2009-10 earnings, which are expected to grow at 18 per cent, and GDP at 8 per cent, with confidence in both these numbers eroding with every passing week. Inflation was at 4.4 per cent in July 2007, it is 5.1 per cent today, and the global situation is far worse now with the US about to enter a recession. Does this count as such a substantial ""derating"" of our market, given the environment? I doubt it very much. The short point I am making is that it may not always be prudent to jump into buying stocks simply because they have fallen a lot from their peaks. Just a few months back, we were in ""saner"" markets and these levels would not have appeared to be so screamingly low then. The point about July is also important as between July 2007 and now domestic mutual funds have seen net inflows of $7 billion. If you add portfolio management service or PMS flows, the number would be much higher. Most of these investors would now be under water; their investments are in the red. Significant redemptions have not happened yet but they have started and I hear rich individuals are already queuing to take money out of large PMS products. This is inevitable, as it would be the natural inclination of any individual now to preserve whatever profits he has or cut losses. This may explain why mutual funds have not been aggressive deployers of their cash holdings in recent weeks.","In his analysis, Udayan Mukherjee discusses the current state of the stock market, highlighting the lack of significant value buying despite a sharp decline in the Sensex. He compares the present situation to July 2007, emphasizing that the market conditions then were not dramatically different. Back then, the Sensex traded at a higher PE ratio, with higher GDP and earnings growth expectations compared to now. Mukherjee notes that the current environment, including higher inflation and global recession concerns, does not justify a substantial derating of the market. He cautions against hasty buying decisions based solely on recent market declines, suggesting that investors should consider whether current levels were perceived as low in a more stable market environment just a few months ago. Mukherjee also mentions the impact of investor sentiment, highlighting the potential for redemptions from mutual funds and portfolio management services as investors seek to preserve profits or minimize losses. This cautious approach by investors could explain the lack of aggressive deployment of cash holdings by mutual funds in recent weeks.",Business and Finance,2008-05-18 00:00:00
"Andhra shuts more liquor shops, Dy CM points to poll promise","The Andhra Pradesh government has shut down more liquor shops in the state amid the lockdown to discourage liquor consumption as it works towards implementing total prohibition â€” a poll promise of the YSR Congress party. Nearly 456 shops have been closed now as per an order issued by Special Chief Secretary (Revenue) Dr Rajat Bharghava. The government has, in effect, reduced the total number of shops by 33 per cent â€” from 4,380 to 2,934 â€” after it took over all the liquor shops last October. The government has increased liquor prices by 75 per cent and reduced the possession limit to three bottles of any size. Laws have been enacted to ensure strict action for violation of the limit or illegal sale of liquor. A special drive was launched on April 11 to control illicit liquor during the lockdown in which 1,462 cases were lodged and 1,282 people arrested. The government also set up a Special Enforcement Bureau to curb illegal transport and manufacture of liquor and illegal transport of sand. Deputy Chief Minister (Excise) K Narayana Swamy said Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised during his pre-poll padyatra that he will implement prohibition to promote healthy living. â€œWe are fulfilling that promise. We have already shut down 43,000 illegal liquor shops besides cancelling licences of sitting rooms attached to liquor shops. Business hours have been reduced from 10 am to 10 pm to 11 am to 8 pm. And we have drastically increased prices of liquor to discourage people from buying,â€™â€™ he said. Officials said the government started working towards prohibition last October when it took over all 4,380 liquor shops and closed down 880 of them. The AP State Beverages Corporation Ltd took over the shops to curb illegal sale and reduced the business hours. The government also cancelled licences of 310 bars, reducing their number to 530. Officials said that from October 2019 to March 2020, there was a drastic fall in the sale of liquor (24%) and beer (55%). The government has also initiated measures to control interstate illicit distillation and non-duty liquor trade. Interstate coordination meetings have been held and plans are afoot for joint raids.","The government has, in effect, reduced the total number of shops by 33 per cent â€” from 4,380 to 2,934 â€” after it took over all the liquor shops last October.",Politics,2020-05-22 00:00:00
"Until trust is rebuilt, Kashmir will not become the Union’s territory","The fortunes of an entire state lie changed on a piece of paper. The President of India has signed off on it, and Parliament has endorsed it. Overnight, a state has been bifurcated; its history changed; its geography altered. Jammu and Kashmir is no longer the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the crown on India’s head. It has been cleaved into two neat union territories. Or not so neat. By defanging Article 370, which gave the state its special status, the government may have fulfilled a promise it made in its election manifesto, but it may just have ended up giving the Kashmir insurgency a new lease of life. The stealth with which the government went about its move, in fact, points to a festering fault line: it inherently does not trust Kashmiris. It doesn’t trust the Kashmiris with common liberties. As far as the government is concerned, a Kashmiri with a phone and an Internet connection is a threat, more than four Kashmiris on the street are a threat and so the dramatic move to repeal the status came packaged with Section 144 that prohibits the assembly of people. It also doesn’t trust mainstream politicians; its own allies in the past, and so they must stay confined in a guest house. The problem is that the Kashmiri does not trust New Delhi either. The trust on both sides has eroded over the years, and we saw how it reached breakpoint after the killing of militant commander Burhan Wani in 2016. Precious human lives were lost and hundreds were injured, and many blinded in clashes in which security forces fired pellets to quell enraged youth. Fearing a repeat of 2016, the Centre has clamped down on Kashmir — even as Jammu and Ladakh rejoice — but the question really is, for how long will the Valley stay under a security blanket? We don’t know what is happening on the ground in Kashmir. People are being allowed to breathe only within the walls of their homes. It would be safe to surmise that the Valley resembles a large open air prison with at least 35,000 more pair of boots. Edgy soldiers must be parading the streets of a place that has now been cleared of all tourists and yatris. The messaging, the signalling is all so anti-Kashmiri: the state has secured those it wanted out and the rest have simply been confined. The confinement could come at a cost. It may swell the ranks of separatists; it may feed the rage and increase the distance between Srinagar and New Delhi. It may even push mainstream politicians such as Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti to speak a language they haven’t spoken before. The National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party — who have both allied with the BJP in the past — may now have been pushed so far into a corner they may no longer be the bridge between Kashmir and the Centre. Abdullah has already called the move to alter the special status an “act of aggression” and Mufti has repeated herself by saying that there will be no one to fly the tricolour. The problem is that Delhi will not mind. A process of delimitation will change the contours of political power that will benefit it. It also believes — and home minister Amit Shah articulated as much — that Article 370 is at the root of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, and that its removal will end the bloodshed. He may be wrong. Its repeal could lead to more bloodshed and encourage Pakistan to fish in muddied waters. Speaking in Parliament, Shah also said, “We are ready to die for Kashmir.” He and his government need to change not just their phraseology but their approach. It would have been better if he had tweaked his words, just a little, to say, “We are ready to die for Kashmiris.” Shah believes development is the answer to the Kashmir problem. He may be off the mark here too. He and his government need to forge an emotional bond with the Valley and accept that like previous governments, they too are guilty on several counts. Guilty of believing that the military can solve the problem for them. Guilty of believing that economic packages can help them buy their way out of what is essentially a political problem that needs sustained dialogue. Guilty of believing that the cleaving of a state is a magic bullet that will rid the Valley of an insurgency that is being sustained by locals. There are no short-cuts to the problem, and till real solutions are sought and trust rebuilt, Kashmir will not become the Union’s territory.","The article reflects on the profound implications of India's decision to revoke Article 370 and bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir into Union Territories. It critiques the government's approach as undermining trust with Kashmiris, seen in the clampdown on liberties and detention of politicians. The piece questions the efficacy of this move in resolving Kashmir's insurgency, fearing it may exacerbate tensions and push mainstream leaders towards more radical positions. It calls for a shift from a militaristic to a dialogic approach, suggesting that lasting solutions require rebuilding trust and addressing Kashmir's political complexities rather than relying on legislative changes alone.",National News,2019-08-06 00:00:00
"Arctic may have ice-free summers as early as the 2030s, warns study","Even in a best-case scenario, the Arctic will begin to experience summer months with no sea ice sometime around the middle of the century — sooner than leading climate scientists had predicted, new research finds. The United Nations-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in its most recent landmark report that the region would start to see Septembers without sea ice around 2050 if humans continue to emit greenhouse gases at high or moderate levels. However, the new study, published on Tuesday in Nature Communications, says this will happen even in a low-emissions scenario. Higher emissions will result in ice-free Septembers by 2030 to 2040. “We basically are saying that it has become too late to save the Arctic summer sea ice,” said Dirk Notz, an oceanographer at the University of Hamburg in Germany who specializes in sea ice and is one of the authors of the study, as well as an IPCC report author. “There’s nothing really we can do about this complete loss anymore, because we’ve been waiting for too long.” While the IPCC speculated that an ice-free summer would likely take place for the first time before 2050, the models it looked at allowed for some hope that a low-emissions path could postpone such a grim milestone, Notz said. Arctic sea-ice coverage is typically lowest in September, at the end of the summer, before growing again in the colder, darker autumn and winter months and peaking in March. Its loss has global repercussions. As the difference in temperature between the Arctic and lower latitudes narrows, fluctuations in the jet stream will become more intense. A warmer Arctic will quicken permafrost melt, releasing more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, accelerating a dangerous feedback loop. The Greenland ice sheet would likely melt more quickly as well, meaning higher seas. ‘If there is Arctic sea ice melting faster than predicted, then what we can immediately expect is Arctic warming will be faster,” said Seung-Ki Min, a study and IPCC author and an environmental science professor at South Korea’s Pohang University of Science and Technology. The new study advances previous research by separating and quantifying the impact of human-made, or anthropogenic, greenhouse gases on ice loss from other natural factors that can cause variability in the data, like volcanic eruptions. It found that about 90% of Arctic sea-ice melting is caused by the former, versus 10% by natural forces. When that now-measurable human impact is integrated into climate models, it provides a clearer picture of when the ice will disappear than other methods — for example, trying to extrapolate from past temperature trends, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow & Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder, who was not involved with the study. “We are destined to lose the end of summer sea ice in the Arctic in the future,” Serreze said. “The question has always been when, and the question of when is complicated by a number of factors.” These include flaws in existing climate models and a huge amount of natural variability in climate data. Within any given year, changes in weather patterns are almost impossible to predict, while phenomena like El Niño or La Niña can cause swings that last several years. Knowing that the loss of sea ice is primarily being caused by human activity means people can work to slow that loss, said Notz. But as climate modeling improves, he predicts there will be more bad news to come. “I am expecting that more and more of these kind of studies will come out, looking at other parts of the Earth system, that will also say: ‘We’ve been warning you all the time; you didn’t react and now it’s too late to do something.’”","New research suggests that even in a best-case scenario, the Arctic will experience summer months with no sea ice around the middle of the century, sooner than previously predicted by leading climate scientists.

Acne problem? Stay away from vitamin B12 supplements,"A new study suggests that to reduce acne, one should pass up on supplements of Vitamin B12. However, the study also says that natural sources of the nutrient should not be neglected. While natural sources of Vitamin B12 are essential for the body, taking a supplemental dose is not practical if you want to get rid of acne. The lead author Li Huiying tells in an interview with Relaxnews, ""Vitamin B12 is essential to us. I hope people do not misinterpret the results of our study and think vitamin B12 is bad."" The team of scientists from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), who did the study, says that it works in a similar way as gut bacteria that live in intestines and keep you healthy. Friendly facial bacteria can become unsettled by vitamin B12, leading to inflammation and eventually to pimples, according to the study published in Translational Medicine. Vitamin B12 changes how genes behave in the facial microbiota -- the term scientists use to describe the community of bacteria that lives on your face even after washing -- leading to activity changes in these critters. After coming up with that as a hypothesis, the scientists tested it by analysing skin microbiota in healthy volunteers who took supplements of vitamin B12. One of their 10 subjects developed acne within a week of vitamin B12 supplementation. To further test their hypothesis, the scientists cultured acne-causing bacterium P acnes and supplemented it with vitamin B12. At this moment, they saw increased production of a group of organic compounds called porphyrins, which are well known to promote acne, according to the paper. The idea that supplementing your diet with vitamin B12 brings about acne isn't new; the scientists say in their paper that it's been observed for sometime now, but they think their discovery of the molecular mechanism behind it could lead to new treatments. ""Some of the genes in the pathways described in our study potentially could be drug targets for new acne treatments,"" says Huiying.","A study from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) suggests that while Vitamin B12 is essential for the body, supplements of the nutrient may exacerbate acne. The research found that Vitamin B12 disrupts the balance of facial bacteria, leading to inflammation and pimples. This disturbance in the microbiota can trigger the production of compounds that promote acne. The study, published in Translational Medicine, involved analyzing the skin microbiota of individuals taking Vitamin B12 supplements. One subject developed acne after supplementation, confirming the hypothesis. The scientists believe that understanding this molecular mechanism could lead to new acne treatments by targeting specific genes. Lead author Li Huiying emphasizes the importance of natural sources of Vitamin B12 for overall health, cautioning against misinterpretation of the study's findings.",Health and Wellness,2015-06-30 00:00:00
Students go the extra mile to ensure a clean city,"Initiative taken up on Collector’s call on Facebook For two days, students, voluntary organisations, and private agencies in Kozhikode joined hands with the district administration and the municipal corporation to clean up unused toilets, to get walls cleaned and give them a fresh coat of paint, besides doing art work on them. All based on nothing more than good will and a sense of service. It was on Friday that District Collector U.V. Jose sent out a call through the Collector Kozhikode Facebook post for his followers to come forward to ensure cleanliness in the city. “Let us set aside differences for once and work united for this goal,” he had said, pointing out that the deplorable condition of public toilets in the city, unavailability of contractors to manage them as well as the way people use public toilets were responsible for the situation. On Saturday morning, students under the NSS technical cell started work. Students of polytechnics took the initiative to fix faulty pipelines and clean public toilets at Palayam, while the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society took up the renovation of the toilet complex at the mofussil bus stand. On Sunday, students of various colleges in the city under the ‘Campuses of Kozhikode’ project cleaned public spaces that had become dumping grounds and walls of flyovers covered with posters. Later, these spaces were given a fresh coat of paint, so that the public would not want to spoil there anymore. “The response from the student body in the city was overwhelming. At least 500 students participated in the programme over the two days,” the Collector said. The programme was actively supported by the municipal corporation that provided the necessary equipment. “Our aim is to form a network of toilets across the district. This is only the first step,” Mr. Jose said, adding that toilets at restaurants and petrol pumps would also be included in the network after grading them. To fill up gaps, new toilet complexes are also being considered. “There is a scarcity of responsible agencies to maintain toilets. There is also a need to fix a benchmark for cleanliness,” the Collector observed. Year of Sanitation Incidentally, the district administration is observing 2018 as the Year of Sanitation and aims to cover the basic sanitary indicators in the district by the end of the year.","In Kozhikode, India, students, voluntary organizations, and private agencies, along with the district administration and municipal corporation, joined forces to clean and renovate unused toilets, walls, and public spaces.

How technology is being used to fight disease-carrying mosquitoes,"American technology companies are bringing automation and robotics to the age-old task of battling mosquitoes in a bid to halt the spread of Zika and other mosquito-borne maladies worldwide. Firms including Microsoft Corp and California life sciences company Verily are forming partnerships with public health officials in several US states to test new high-tech tools. In Texas, Microsoft is testing a smart trap to isolate and capture Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, known Zika carriers, for study by entomologists to give them a jump on predicting outbreaks. Verily, Alphabet’s life sciences division based in Mountain View, California, is speeding the process for creating sterile male mosquitoes to mate with females in the wild, offering a form of birth control for the species. While it may take years for these advances to become widely available, public health experts say new players brings fresh thinking to vector control, which still relies heavily on traditional defenses such as larvicides and insecticides. “It’s exciting when technology companies come on board,” said Anandasankar Ray, an associate professor of entomology at the University of California, Riverside. “Their approach to a biological challenge is to engineer a solution.” The Zika epidemic that emerged in Brazil in 2015 and left thousands of babies suffering from birth defects has added urgency to the effort. While cases there have slowed markedly, mosquitoes capable of carrying the virus — Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus — are spreading in the Americas, including large swaths of the southern United States. The vast majority of the 5,365 Zika cases reported in the United States so far are from travellers who contracted the virus elsewhere. Still, two states — Texas and Florida — have recorded cases transmitted by local mosquitoes, making them prime testing grounds for new technology. In Texas, 10 mosquito traps made by Microsoft are operating in Harris County, which includes the city of Houston. Roughly the size of large birdhouses, the devices use robotics, infrared sensors, machine learning and cloud computing to help health officials keep tabs on potential disease carriers. Texas recorded six cases of local mosquito transmission of Zika in November and December of last year. Experts believe the actual number is likely higher because most infected people do not develop symptoms. Pregnant women are at high risk because they can pass the virus to their foetuses, resulting in a variety of birth defects. Those include microcephaly, a condition in which infants are born with undersized skulls and brains. The World Health Organization declared Zika a global health emergency in February 2016. The Microsoft machines differentiate insects by measuring a feature unique to each species: the shadows cast by their beating wings. When a trap detects an Aedes aegypti in one of its 64 chambers, the door slams shut. Other companies, meanwhile, are developing technology to shrink mosquito populations by rendering male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes sterile. When these sterile males mate with females in the wild, their eggs don’t hatch. The strategy offers an alternative to chemical pesticides. But it requires the release of millions of laboratory-bred mosquitoes into the outdoors. Males don’t bite, which has made this an easier sell to places now hosting tests. At MosquitoMate’s labs in Lexington, immature mosquitoes are forced through a sieve-like mechanism that separates the smaller males from the females. These mosquitoes are then hand sorted to weed out any stray females that slip through. “That’s basically done using eyeballs,” said Stephen Dobson, MosquitoMate’s chief executive. Enter Verily. The company is automating mosquito sorting with robots to make it faster and more affordable. Company officials declined to be interviewed. But on its website, Verily says it’s combining sensors, algorithms and “novel engineering” to speed the process. Verily and MosquitoMate have teamed up to test their technology in Fresno, California, where Aedes aegypti arrived in 2013. Officials worry that residents who contract Zika elsewhere could spread it in Fresno if they’re bitten by local mosquitoes that could pass the virus to others. “That is very much of a concern because it is the primary vector for diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and obviously Zika,” said Steve Mulligan, manager of the Consolidated Mosquito Abatement District in Fresno County. The study, which still needs state and federal approval, is slated for later this summer.","American tech giants like Microsoft and Verily (Alphabet’s life sciences division) are collaborating with public health officials to combat mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika through automation and robotics. Microsoft is testing smart mosquito traps in Texas that use sensors and machine learning to identify and capture Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, while Verily is automating the production of sterile male mosquitoes to reduce populations by preventing reproduction. Traditional methods like insecticides are still in use, but these innovations offer promising, pesticide-free solutions. Verily and MosquitoMate plan to launch trials in Fresno, California, where concerns about local transmission of Zika and other viruses remain high.",Technology and Gadgets,2017-07-11 00:00:00
"Christmas 2023: Know date, history, significance, traditions of this day and why it's celebrated on 25th December","The holiday season is upon us as we gear up to welcome the most joyous time of the year - Christmas. The day commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ. It is marked as a religious and commercial holiday. As we near Christmas week, the holiday cheer starts filling the air as you see twinkling lights decked everywhere, ornaments-adorned Christmas trees at malls and offices, the smell of cinnamon and gingerbreads, and meet close friends and family to make memories. Christmas is one of the most sacred days for Christians. People spend the day singing carols, eating delicious plum cakes, exchanging gifts, visiting friends, spending time with family, and cooking a decadent meal. They also decorate their homes with a Christmas tree adorned with personalised ornaments, wreaths on the front door, and stockings over the fireplace. Additionally, kids wait for Santa Claus and his gifts that arrive on Christmas Eve night and are opened first thing in the morning. If you and your loved ones observe this joyous day, you should know when it is celebrated, its history, importance, and significance. Christmas 2023 Date:Every year, Christmas falls on December 25. In 2023, the 25th of December is on Monday. Christmas Eve will be celebrated on December 24, Sunday. Christmas 2023 History and Significance: Why is Christmas celebrated on December 25?Christmas, derived from the words 'Mass of Christ', marks the birth of Jesus Christ. Jesus was born in Bethlehem to his parents, Joseph and Mary. He was conceived through the Holy Spirit and was born when Mother Mary was engaged to Joseph. It is believed that Mother Mary learned she would be giving birth to a special child on March 25, and nine months later, on December 25, Jesus was born. However, there is no proof that he was born on December 25, as the Gregorian calendar did not exist back then. Instead, the story of Jesus Christ's birth is in the New Testament's gospel of Saint Luke and Saint Matthew. The first time the birth of Jesus Christ was attributed to the date December 25 was in the 4th century, according to early Roman history. Christmas was first celebrated on record in 336, during the reign of Constantine, the first Christian Roman emperor and the Roman emperor at the time. Countries around the world have different names for festivals. It is referred to as Yuletide in Germany, Navidad in Spanish, Natale in Italian, and Noël in French. Moreover, some Christians celebrate Jesus Christ's birth on January 6, the Epiphany, when they believe he was baptized. Meanwhile, the Christmas holiday came into being with the legend of St Nicholas and his many miracles. Although much of his history is unconfirmed, the man who became St. Nicholas lived in the 4th century and is believed to have been a bishop in Asia Minor. In his honour, the Feast of St Nicholas was marked on December 6 and gifts were given the night before. The tradition was well-established in many European countries by the 12th century. Eventually, because St. Nicholas' Day and Christmas Day are so close together, their traditions generally were combined. Christmas holds religious importance for Christians. They remember Jesus Christ on this day and recall his sacrifices for humanity. People also hold mass services and thank Jesus for removing hatred and greed from the world, eradicating evil, and prevailing happiness. They believe that since he came to salvage the entire humanity of all the suffering his ultimate sacrifice during crucifixion needs to be commemorated. Christmas 2023 Traditions:Several traditions are associated with Christmas. The most common activities are baking cakes and cookies, decorating Christmas trees with ornaments, visiting church, shopping for close friends and family, enjoying Christmas feats with loved ones, singing carols, and going to mass. Kids also wait for Santa Claus to arrive on Christmas Eve and enter their homes through the chimney with their gifts. However, Christmas traditions vary from region to region.","Every year, Christmas falls on December 25. In 2023, the 25th of December is on Monday.

Aldermen vote bid halts 3rd attempt to elect MCD mayor,"New Delhi : The Capital’s elected municipal council members failed for the third time to elect a mayor for the city on Monday after a series of controversial decisions by the presiding officer, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member, triggered outrage from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has the majority in the House. While things did not come to a chaotic pass as they had exactly a month ago – the first Municipal Corporation Delhi (MCD) House meeting on January 6 descended into a brawl among members – the developments on Monday saw allegations and counter-allegations of poaching and violations of constitutional norms. At the heart of Monday’s controversy was the decision by the presiding officer, Satya Sharma, to allow nominated members, known as aldermen, to vote in the election for the mayor. Such members have not voted in the mayor or deputy mayor elections in the past and the law — the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act — prohibits their participation. “Allowing nominated councillors to vote is illegal and unconstitutional. This is open hooliganism. We will take the matter to the Supreme Court and we are hopeful that the apex court will protect the Constitution and laws made as per the Constitution,” said Delhi’s deputy chief minister and AAP leader Manish Sisodia, adding that the BJP’s strategy was to hold up the election process so that the civic body could be run “illegally through bureaucrats”. Two other decisions by Sharma were protested by AAP: She ordered that the elections for the posts of mayor, deputy mayor and the six standing committee members will be held simultaneously, and directed two AAP MLAs to leave the chambers because they were ostensibly ineligible to vote due to their convictions in legal cases.","The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) failed for the third time to elect a mayor on Monday due to controversial decisions by the presiding officer, BJP member Satya Sharma, sparking outrage from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which holds a majority.

Fardeen Khan recalls Kareena Kapoor recommended him for Dev as film clocks 20 years: ‘Will always be grateful to her,"Fardeen Khan keeps sharing throwback updates for his fans on social media. The actor recently penned a gratitude note as Govind Nihalani's Dev completed 20 years. Fardeen revealed that his co-star Kareena Kapoor had recommended him for the Amitabh Bachchan-starrer political action-drama. The Heeramandi actor took to his Instagram handle and shared a reel where his character Farhan Ali is seen saying intense dialogues about religion and communal divide. In the video, glimpses of Kareena, Amitabh, and late actor Om Puri amid gunshots and blasts are depicted. Fardeen captioned his post as, “It was my third film with @kareenakapoorkhan and it was she who recommended me for the role, and I will always be grateful to her for that. Being signed by the respected Govind Nihalani for a film with legends like @amitabhbachchan and Om Puri was a huge endorsement for any actor. Govindji was highly respected and was known for his careful direction and powerful storytelling. He further wrote, “This role gave me the chance to work on a film that was relevant and meaningful, which was rare at the time. But the greatest take away for me from DEV was getting to share the screen with Amitji, an actor I idolized. His life and most amazing career have had a profound influence on Indian cinema and has left an indelible mark on not just me but on every Indian. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, a true honour and an absolute privilege to work with him, making it one of the highlights of my career.” Fardeen and Kareena were also paired opposite each other in Fida which released in the same year after Dev. The duo acted in three films together including Khushi (2003). Fardeen was recently seen in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Heeramandi as Nawab Wali Bin Zayed-Al Mohammed. The show was Fardeen's acting comeback after an almost 14-year-gap. The epic drama series also featured Manisha Koirala, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditi Rao Hydari, Sharmin Segal, Richa Chadha, Shekhar Suman and Adhyayan Suman in crucial roles.

"Naidu trying to shift blame for Guntur tragedy, says former Minister","Former Minister and YSR Congress Party MLA Perni Venkata Ramaiah (Nani) criticised the TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu that the latter was “playing havoc with the lives of people by mobilising them in large numbers for his publicity craze”. Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters here on Monday, he said that the TDP resorted to politics of distributing gifts to the poor in the name of ‘Sankranti Kanuka’ and claimed the lives of three people in Guntur city on Sunday. He alleged that the TDP leaders who carried out publicity and took permission from the police for organising a meeting with 10,000 people had taken a U-turn after the tragedy. The TDP leaders also announced that Mr. Chandrababu Naidu had no connection with the tragedy and started blaming Vuyyuru Foundation. “Why did the TDP leaders issue 30,000 coupons to the people when they have taken permission from the police for organising a public meeting with 10,000 people?

History in black & white: Gukesh is the Candidate,"Bengaluru : D Gukesh made his way down the stairs of the Great Hall in downtown Toronto on Sunday night, and outside its heavy doors, a bright sliver of stardom awaited. A throng of Indian chess fans, holding up phones and cameras, greeted him with chants of his name. The Chennai boy, all of 17, strode into the blinding lights, resembling a UFC fighter’s walkout, engulfed by people jostling for selfies and videos as security personnel escorted him into a waiting mini van. It was a rare sight in chess. And one that he will have to get used to. Gukesh made history by becoming the youngest-ever player to win the Fide Candidates tournament. He smashed former world champion Garry Kasparov’s record (20 years, 11 months) by over three years, and became the only Indian other than his mentor Viswanathan Anand to win the Candidates. He will face Ding Liren later this year in the biggest match of his young life. The World Championship clash will be the first time in a decade that an Indian will be in a fight for the world title since Anand at Sochi in 2014. Gukesh was eight years old at the time. In a Chessbase India interview in 2017, when Gukesh was asked what he wants to become when he grows up, without missing a beat the 11-year-old replied: “I want to be the youngest world champion!” He’ll be 18 at the time of the match. Should he win, he’ll become the youngest undisputed world chess champion in history. Far from a favourite going into the tournament, through three weeks and 14 rounds of classical chess, Gukesh remained unruffled against some of the world’s best and most experienced names in his first Candidates appearance. He lost only one game in a time scramble, and went into the final round as the sole leader ahead of two of the world’s top three players and a two-time Candidates winner. A draw with black pieces in Round 14 against world No. 3 Hikaru Nakamura was enough for the Indian while the must-win game between two members of the chasing pack, Ian Nepomniachtchi and Fabiano Caruana, turned into a mad jangle of nerves and errors before ending in a marathon 109-move draw. “Right now I’m just so happy and relieved about winning the tournament,” Gukesh told FIDE after the tournament. “I don’t care about the youngest and all these records…but it’s a nice thing to say.” With this performance, Gukesh moved up to world No 6 in the live ratings, one spot above reigning world champion Ding Liren. Gukesh is no stranger to “youngest-ever” tags either. In 2019, he became the world’s second-youngest Grandmaster, missing Sergey Karjakin’s record by just 17 days. What’s been striking about Gukesh at the Candidates is his calm, nerveless approach to the biggest tournament of his career. He’s managed to surprise opponents with his tenacity and spunk, and hold his own against formidable names through torrid game situations. He would typically walk into the playing hall, arrange his pieces on the board, and sit with his eyes closed for a few moments before the start of the games. Dignitaries were called in to make the ceremonial first move, and while players would chip in the applause, Gukesh would sit with his arms crossed across his chest, detached from the proceedings. He didn’t dazzle with flash and frenzy right away. But as the tournament wore on, Gukesh slowly revealed his cool genius. Since the pandemic, the pack of Indian chess prodigies have been on an upswing. Gukesh had a terrific 2022 Olympiad with a flawless 8/8 score. But despite some stellar performances, he ended up flying a bit under the radar. No sponsors were making a beeline for him, and somehow, some of his biggest moments appeared to be eclipsed by fellow prodigies. He was the first player to displace Anand in the published ratings and became India’s top-ranked chess player during the World Cup last year. He went as far as the quarterfinals, where he lost to world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen. But Praggnanandhaa had a terrific run in the same World Cup, going into the final & finishing runner-up to qualify for the Candidates. “He’s (Gukesh) not as high-profile as some of the other youngsters, which is confusing,” Carlsen said on the chess24 stream during the final round, “But he’s proven in this tournament that he’s very strong.” Five-time world champion Anand has had a significant role to play in the accelerated growth of these prodigies through the Westbridge Anand Chess Academy set up in 2021. For the first time, a record number of five Indian players qualified for this year’s Candidates. Three of them, Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa and R Vaishali,are his mentees. “A huge part of a long, high-pressure tournament such as the Candidates is having the right mentality; to be able to detach yourself from the result and just play your best chess. Gukesh did this by finding a right mixture of chess and some degree of fitness,” said Anand. Just before the start of the Candidates, at a dinner with Anand, Gukesh said that his favourite country was Spain because of his results there. But one can be sure that, after Sunday, Toronto and Canada have more than forced their way into that argument.","D Gukesh, at 17, becomes the youngest-ever winner of the Fide Candidates tournament, surpassing Garry Kasparov's record. His calm demeanor and tenacity surprised opponents. Mentored by Viswanathan Anand, he heads to face Ding Liren for the World Championship, potentially becoming the youngest world chess champion in history if victorious.",Sports,2024-04-23 00:00:00

The mission, designated Crew-5, marks the fifth full-fledged ISS crew NASA has flown aboard a SpaceX vehicle since the private rocket venture founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk began sending US astronauts aloft in May 2020. The SpaceX launch vehicle, consisting of a Falcon 9 rocket topped with a Crew Dragon capsule dubbed Endurance, lifted off into clear skies at noon from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. The two-stage, 23-story-tall Falcon 9 ascended from the launch tower as its nine Merlin engines roared to life in billowing clouds of vapor and a reddish-orange fireball. The mission is notable for the inclusion of Anna Kikina, 38, the lone female cosmonaut on active duty with Roscosmos, making it the first spaceflight with a Russian launched from US soil in two decades. As the spacecraft entered Earth's orbit, Kikina radioed her thanks to NASA, Roscosmos and their International Space Station partners for ""giving us this great opportunity."" Moments after reaching the orbit, as mission control wished the crew ""Godspeed"", Mann radioed back, ""Awesome. Thank you so much to the Falcon team. Whew! That was a smooth ride uphill."" The team will be welcomed by seven existing ISS occupants as well as two Russians and the NASA astronaut who flew with them to orbit on a Soyuz flight. ISS, the length of a football field, has been continuously occupied since 2000, operated by a U.S.-Russian-led consortium that includes Canada, Japan and 11 European countries. It was born in part to improve relations between Washington and Moscow following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of Cold War rivalries that spurred the original American-Soviet space race.","A SpaceX rocket successfully launched the Crew-5 mission to the International Space Station (ISS) from Florida.

The Air India crew will have minimum contact with the passengers being flown in, hence no service will take place in the plane. “Whatever food is there will be kept in seat pockets. As there will be no service, there will be no interaction (between cabin crew and passengers),” an Air India spokesman said. He added masks have been arranged for the crew and passengers. “For our crew, we have also arranged complete protective gear,” he said.","India began evacuating its nationals from Wuhan, China, due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has caused over 200 deaths and nearly 10,000 infections. An Air India Boeing 747 left Mumbai on Friday, stopping in New Delhi for supplies before flying to Wuhan. The plane, with 423 seats, will return with 366 Indians by midnight. A second flight is scheduled for Saturday. A team of doctors, a paramedic, engineers, and security personnel are on board. To minimize contact, no in-flight service will occur; food will be placed in seat pockets, and both crew and passengers will use masks and protective gear.",National News,2020-02-01 00:00:00
Knowledge Commission Towards revolutionary recommendations,"DR Pushpa M Bhargava, a former director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology is the vice-chairman of the National Knowledge Commission (NKC) constituted by the Prime Minister. No such commission exists anywhere in the world, and with its unique and exciting mandate it is capable of “transforming society,” believes Dr Bhargava. We explored what the NKC is setting itself up to do. Q: Could you set out the NKC’s mandate? A: There are broadly three objectives. The first is to make India a leader in generation of new knowledge in all fields. We do generate new knowledge, with individual peaks, but as a nation we are not a leader. The second is to make India a knowledge based society. Affluence and a knowledge based society, or even being a knowledge leader, do not go together. The US is an example. The goal is to give people access to information, not to convert them to any point of view. The third is to make governance and industry knowledge based. The higher up you go the more the requirement for a knowledge base. But the higher up you go the less there is of it. That is the tragedy. Q: How will you translate this vision into action? A: We shall present no reports. We shall only be presenting points of action. We have ensured that we are not tied to government rules. With this freedom comes great responsibility. There is a budget of Rs 4.6 crore this year. We will be releasing a statement of account, a utilisation certificate, and we will put everything on the net. Q: What are the elements of your action plan? A: The draft document has been finalised and will be ready for release, perhaps by February. Certain decisions have already been taken, and priority areas identified. This will also be on the web for feedback. The active recommendations are here as well — where an Act will be needed, where a ministerial decision, a cabinet decision etc. We will have meetings in at least 10 cities, with paid advertisements, inviting people to come. Q: The priority areas are obviously science, education and the like? A: Yes, priority one areas are education at all levels (school, technical, university) science and technology, agriculture and the rural sector, traditional knowledge, and governance, including e-governance. The second tier comprises the social sciences, medical and health care, civil society, patents. Q: Can you elaborate on education? A: The UGC is completely inadequate. My personal view, we have to discuss this in the NKC, is that we need to totally ban commercialisation of education, but encourage privatisation. Harvard, Cambridge are private but not commercial institutions. Money goes back into the university. It is not an investment, no individual makes money. Then there is this terrible pain of affiliated colleges. No country in the world has such institutions. We have made all the calculations and we are convinced that spending 6 per cent of GDP on education is an achievable goal. We need 400,000 schools. If we can do that, make sure that no child is refused education, even reservations won’t be needed in the future. Q: What about science and technology, basic science? A: If we create a large base, excellence will emerge. In the short term, and the PM is very keen we do something in the short term, we have some ideas. One way is to get senior scientists from India and abroad, and talented youngsters, with a vision and an ability to excite people, to get together for brain-storming sessions in various fields. We will identify major unsolved problems in those areas. Then we say, who wants to work on it? Tell me what you need, you will get it. Q: At some point, you are going to run into ideological debates. A: Our recommendations will be based on reason, with the largest interests of the country in mind. People are not fools. They will see through anything else. We would like to give our recommendations to farmers unions, all the trade unions; it will be on the net. Let us have feedback. Many of our recommendations will have serious opposition. If they are genuine, based on knowledge and reason, we will take it into account. If they are from vested interests, we will reject them. Q: What about the relationship knowledge has with questions of spirituality, religion, identity, heritage and so on? A: Values are never in conflict, but vague ill-defined concepts of spirituality will definitely be. Education about religion is fine, but not propagating religion. The mixing up of religion and history is not on either. As for identity, if we really want to act as a responsible knowledge commission, the first identity is the human identity. We owe something to the entire human race. The second identity is the national identity. The nation-state is a reality. If the system of imparting knowledge is correct then these issues are resolved for every individual. There is a whole section on what kind of citizens we want to have, what the desirable values are. Simple things like not to make oneself an exception for rules. We want to go through a red light, but no one else should. Q: What about language issues? A: We are very clear on this, with a fair amount of consensus. The fact is that every child, every parent, in every town and village wants English, to be proficient in it. It is the politicians who don’t want them to have it. Our languages are important, certainly, but in the world of tomorrow, please do not create, and this may yet turn out to be the most significant divide, two classes — those who are proficient in English, and those who are not. It is the disadvantaged who will suffer.","The National Knowledge Commission (NKC) in India, led by Dr. Pushpa M Bhargava, aims to make India a leader in generating new knowledge, transform it into a knowledge-based society, and apply knowledge in governance and industry. The NKC emphasizes education, science, technology, agriculture, rural development, traditional knowledge, and governance. Dr. Bhargava advocates a ban on the commercialization of education, encouraging privatization without profit motive, and allocating 6% of GDP to education. The commission plans to engage in brain-storming sessions, seek feedback, and prioritize reason over ideological debates. Language issues, especially English proficiency, are considered essential for future opportunities.",Opinion and Editorial,2005-11-13 00:00:00
"More than 50 per cent Metro project workers leave, Maha-Metro says work will slow down but continue","Of the over 2,800 labourers working for the Pune Metro project in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, nearly 1,600 have left for their home states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar Jharkhand and West Bengal in the last 15 days, since Shramik Special trains and buses started plying. But officials of Maha-Metro, the implementing agency for the project, said Metro work will continue despite the departure of hundreds of workers. ""The work will slow down for sure. But we will not stop the work, it will continue,"" Maha-Metro spokesperson Hemant Sonawane told The Indian Express on Thursday. Maha-Metro officials said they tried to convince the workers to stay back, but they refused to do so. ""We held several round of meetings with them. We urged them to stay as Metro had ensured all facilities for them, besides taking care of their health. We even urged them to go back in batches. however, they refused to heed our pleas. We don't know the exact reason but we guess. they wanted to be with their loved ones at this point of time,"" said Sonawane. Metro work in Pune had come to a complete halt when the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, and it eventually started again on April 30. ""The contractors are trying to get in touch with labourers who are already at their native places. They are hopeful of getting some labourers back after more trains start plying after June 1.,"" said Sonawane. He said there were no issues pertaining to labourers' salaries. ""We have ensured that the labour contractors make full payments to the workers. If that was not the case, the labourers would not have remained with us for the first 40-45 days of the lockdown,"" said Sonawane. He said several arrangements were made for the workers during the lockdown. ""Medical check-ups of the labourers were conducted regularly at the camps. they were provided recreational facilities like TV sets, carrom boards and chess boards. Mask and sanitisers were distributed and social distancing norms were strictly implemented. As a result, not a single labourer was detected with coronavirus,"" said Sonawane. Metro officials, however, said they weren't looking to hire labourers locally. ""This is because local workers usually avoid construction work.,"" said a Metro official, adding that the agency will wait for the return of labourers who have gone back home.","Metro work in Pune had come to a complete halt when the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, and it eventually started again on April 30.",Politics,2020-05-22 00:00:00

"Cases, positivity rate creep up in Capital","Delhi recorded 813 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, the most since December 24, and the test positivity rate rose beyond the 1% mark for the first time since December 27, suggesting that the Capital may be on the brink of yet another outbreak. The increase has been particularly sharp since Monday, March 15, when the city saw 368 cases. The trend is in tandem with similar rise in infections in several other states, particularly Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana. Overall, the weekly average of new cases a day across India has risen from around 23,500 on March 15 to over 31,600 on March 19. A Delhi government spokesperson said the situation in the Capital is under control. “Delhi’s surge is on expected lines and even if cases explode, we are well prepared and experienced by now to take necessary actions. We still urge people to take all precautions and follow Covid appropriate behaviour, especially in the light of the festive season ahead. People should not let their guards down,” said an official, while underscoring that other regions such as Maharashtra, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh “have much higher positivity rate”. The spokesperson reiterated the Delhi government’s appeal to open up the vaccination drive to include all people above the age of 18. “At present, vaccination is the most effective way to curb the spread of Covid-19. Hence, the government has requested the Centre to open vaccination to all adult citizens of the city. Vaccination centres are also being increased along with their timings being extended by 4 hours,” the spokesperson said. Union government officials have in recent days attributed the rise in infections to the recent wedding season. On Saturday, at least two district health officials in Delhi said several more factors could be to blame. “Out of the five states that have seen the number of cases shoot up recently, one is Delhi’s neighbour. And, the infection is coming in from there,” said one of the officials, asking not to be named. A second district official said that the rise in day temperatures could be forcing people to stay indoors, raising the likelihood of infections. “What we have seen so far is that the cases are among the middle class people, same as it was during the November surge of cases. This, I think, is mainly because of the change in weather prompting them to remain in air-conditioned environments where the spread can happen more easily,” this person said. The second official also added that people who were not exposed previously to the infection may have begun mixing among themselves more, giving the virus access to more vulnerable people. “The seroprevalence in Delhi is 56%, this means that there are still 44% of the people who are susceptible to the infection. It is now spreading among them quickly as interactions go up with everything going back to normal after the number of cases reduced,” this person said. The latest 813 cases came from 75,888 tests. The government spokesperson said the administration is focusing on increasing awareness, increased surveillance, and scaled up enforcement against violation of rules regarding wearing masks and social distancing. “We are doing the highest number of tests compared to other cities. Delhi’s test figures are nearly five times the national average. Vaccination is also being intensified in all districts. We are keenly monitoring areas that had not witnessed a surge during the last three waves in Delhi. Nearly 60% of the 3,409 active cases in the city are contained or inside containment zones and we are tracing at least 31 persons per Covid positive case,” the spokesperson said. Experts said it is crucial to increase vaccination coverage now. “The number of cases and positivity rate increasing is a cause for worry. I expect that by the end of the month, we would start reporting 1,000 cases a day. And, the main thing is that we need to speed up our vaccination drive and for that, we need to remove the current age bar in place. In Delhi, over 50% of the people already have been exposed to the infection, it is the remaining 50% who need to be vaccinated quickly,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences and head of the first committee of the Delhi government on the control and management of Covid-19. Sarin added that the city must also look at what strains are circulating since “we know the efficacy of the Oxford vaccine is lower with the South African variant”. “Another thing we need to ensure is that people who have been vaccinated follow a Covid-19 appropriate behaviour till at least four weeks after receiving the second shot,” he added. According to the Union government’s Co-WIN dashboard, there have been a little over 990,000 doses delivered in the Capital as on Saturday. CM Arvind Kejriwal announced on Friday that the administration will attempt to accelerate the drive by allowing centres to open till 9pm (from 5pm previously) and by increasing the daily capacity to 125,000. The actual number of doses being given in the Capital has fluctuated between 30,000 and 40,000 over the past week, leading to calls for the Union government to relax the eligibility rules for people to seek doses.","Delhi reported 813 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, the highest since December 24, with the test positivity rate surpassing 1% for the first time since December 27. This surge in cases aligns with similar increases in several other states, including Maharashtra, Punjab, and Haryana. The Delhi government emphasizes preparedness and requests the central government to open vaccination for all citizens above 18. Officials attribute the rise to factors like the recent wedding season, neighbor infections, and changing weather patterns, emphasizing the need for increased vaccination coverage and adherence to COVID-appropriate behavior.",Health and Wellness,2021-03-21 00:00:00

South Korea's Park open to dialogue with North,"South Korea's new president will not tolerate North Korean provocations but will continue to push for dialogue with Pyongyang, a special envoy to President-elect Park Geun-hye said just hours after the North's top governing body declared it would continue atomic tests and rocket launches. Park is strongly urging North Korea to refrain from conducting a nuclear test that could only worsen the tensions on the Korean Peninsula in the wake of a provocative long-range rocket launch in December, envoy Rhee In-je told The Associated Press and selected news outlets in Davos, Switzerland. ""President-elect Park makes it clear that North Korea's nuclear ambitions and further provocations against the South will not be tolerated,"" Rhee said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday. ""In particular, she strongly urges North Korea to refrain from further worsening the situation by conducting a third nuclear test."" But Park, who takes office next month, wants to leave the window open to constructive dialogue with Pyongyang and will continue to provide food and medical aid as part of a ""trust-building"" policy for the two Koreas. ""It is a gradual process based on mutual trust and respect, which can begin with keeping promises,"" he said. She also advocates returning to the six-nation disarmament negotiations, Rhee said. North Korea walked away from those talks in 2009 and has said future disarmament talks are out off the table. On Tuesday, the UN Security Council voted unanimously to condemn North Korea's Dec. 12 rocket launch as a violation of a ban against missile activity. The council, including Pyongyang ally China, expanded sanctions against the regime. North Korea's National Defense Commission responded Thursday by declaring that the regime is prepared to conduct a nuclear test in defiance of UN punishment, and it made clear that its long-range rockets are designed to carry not only satellites but also warheads aimed at striking the United States. The commission, North Korea's top governing body led by leader Kim Jong Un, pledged to keep launching satellites and rockets and to conduct a nuclear test as part of a ""new phase"" of combat with the United States, which it blames for leading the UN bid to punish Pyongyang. It said a nuclear test was part of ""upcoming"" action but did not say exactly when or where it would take place. ""We do not hide that a variety of satellites and long-range rockets which will be launched by the DPRK one after another and a nuclear test of higher level which will be carried out by it in the upcoming all-out action, a new phase of the anti-US struggle that has lasted century after century, will target against the US, the sworn enemy of the Korean people,"" the commission said, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said he has seen no outward sign that North Korea will follow through soon on its plan to conduct a test. But that doesn't mean preparations aren't taking place. ""They have the capability, frankly, to conduct these tests in a way that make it very difficult to determine whether or not they are doing it,"" Panetta told reporters in Washington. North Korea claims the right to build nuclear weapons as a defense against the United States, its Korean War foe. Their bitter three-year war ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, in 1953, and left the Korean Peninsula divided by the world's most heavily fortified demilitarized zone. The US leads the UN Command that governs the truce and stations more than 28,000 troops in ally South Korea, a presence that North Korea cites as a key reason for its drive to build nuclear weapons. North Korea is estimated to have stored up enough weaponized plutonium for four to eight bombs, according to scientist Siegfried Hecker, who visited the North's Nyongbyon nuclear complex in 2010. In October, an unidentified spokesman at the National Defense Commission claimed that the US mainland was within missile range. And at a military parade last April, North Korea showed off what appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile. In 2009, Pyongyang declared that it would begin enriching uranium, which would give North Korea a second way to make atomic weapons. The National Defense Commission's allusion to a ""higher level"" nuclear test most likely refers to a device made from highly enriched uranium, said Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea. Experts say North Korea must keep testing its atomic devices so it can make them small enough to mount as nuclear warheads onto long-range missiles. North Korea tested atomic devices in 2006 and 2009 after receiving UN condemnation for launching long-range rockets. The US envoy on North Korean issues, Glyn Davies, urged Pyongyang not to explode an atomic device. ""Whether North Korea tests or not, it's up to North Korea. We hope they don't do it. We call on them not to do it,"" he told reporters in Seoul after meeting Thursday with South Korean officials. ""It will be a mistake and a missed opportunity if they were to do it."" White House spokesman Jay Carney on Thursday said North Korea's aggressive stance is unnecessary and warned against any further testing. ""North Korea's statement is needlessly provocative and a test would be a significant violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions,"" he said. ""Further provocation would only increase Pyongyang's isolation, and its continued focus on its nuclear and missile program is doing nothing to help the North Korean people."" He said the recent UN resolution is a ""strong message of the international community's opposition to North Korean provocations and these tightened sanctions will impede the growth of weapons of mass destruction programs in North Korea and the United States will be taking additional steps in that regard."" Carney did not elaborate on what those steps might be. In Beijing, chief North Korea ally China urged restraint, but declined to directly criticize the North's actions. ""To maintain peninsular peace and stability and achieve denuclearization is conducive to the interests of all sides."" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters Thursday. ""The situation now is sensitive and complicated. We hope all sides can stay calm, be careful what they say and do, and avoid escalating tensions,"" Hong said.","South Korea's incoming president Park Geun-hye plans to take a tough stance on North Korea's nuclear ambitions but keep the door open for dialogue. She opposes further provocations like missile launches and nuclear tests but will continue humanitarian aid. North Korea, however, is defiant. They responded to UN sanctions by vowing to conduct a nuclear test and develop long-range missiles capable of reaching the US. This is seen as a new stage in their struggle against the US. The US and South Korea have urged North Korea to reconsider, while China, their only major ally, called for all sides to stay calm. Experts believe a new test might involve highly enriched uranium and would be used to miniaturize nukes for missiles.",Politics,2013-01-25 00:00:00

"Karnataka woos IT sector with relaxed rules on labour, land","The State government on Tuesday announced that information technology (IT) companies would come under essential services with effect from November 1, making them exempt from general strikes and bandhs. IT and related sectors will also remain outside the purview of the Karnataka Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Rules, 1946, for five more years. According to these Rules, companies are mandated to define and declare staff details such as working hours, wages, attendance and reasons for terminating an employee’s service, among other terms of employment. These and a host of new initiatives are part of the new IT policy, which was unveiled by the Chief Minister after opening the State’s annual infotech show, ITE.biz. ‘Unstinted support’ With Karnataka already leading the country in IT services and exports worth Rs. 1.35 lakh crore, Mr. Siddaramaiah said he hoped the incentives would further spur the growth of electronics, start-ups and knowledge-based industries.

"Winter session of Himachal Assembly: Govt, Oppn debate Jan Manch programmes","Members of the Himachal Pradesh Vidhan Sabha reviewed the â€˜Jan Manchâ€™ programmes, hydel and solar power projects, irrigation schemes near the Gobind Sagar Lake and granting of jobs on compassionate grounds on the final day of the Winter session held here in Tapovan. A discussion on â€˜Jan Manchâ€™ programmes started by the state government two years ago divided the House. BJP MLA Sukh Ram, who brought up the issue under Rule 130, said that the government is delivering basic services to residents on their doorstep. â€œWhether itâ€™s a water connection, pension application, income certificate or construction of a public toilet, the Jan Manch programmes have ensured that these basic complaints are resolved on the spot,â€ he added. Nurpur MLA Rakesh Pathania said that out of 43,286 complaints received during these programmes, 39,566 have been resolved. The food component of the programme also allows the public, executive officers and representatives to break bread together besides resolving issues, some members said. On the other hand, several MLAs retorted that these programmes are a â€œwastage of public moneyâ€ and demands of residents are often delayed on regular days so that they can be disposed off during Jan Manch. Kinnaur MLA Jagat Negi said that Jan Manch only encourages ruling party members and ministers to campaign while Theog MLA Rakesh Singha said that humiliation of officers by ministers in front of the public is not the solution to their problems. Palampur MLA Ashish Butail recounted the case of a woman named Bhago Devi who had complained of water-logging in her house after a government water channel (kuhl) overflowed. â€œThe officials only installed a tarpaulin after four days which soon came off. When her house was flooded again, Bhago Devi ran outside shouting and died of a heart attack,â€ he said. Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said he started â€˜Jan Manchâ€™ to decrease footfall in government offices and ensure that the public does not have to run from pillar to post for basic services. â€œIâ€™m from a village and have gone through such a phase of running around. This is the first scheme in a country where a citizen can hold a microphone and boldly state his grievance in front of everyone,â€ he stated. A total of 326 answers were tabled and discussions were held in 18 different notices during a total sitting period of 28 hours and 50 minutes of the session, Speaker Rajeev Bindal said. Hydel and solar energy The CM said that Himachal contributes 11,000 megawatts in the power sector and both hydel and solar projects are being expanded under schemes such as the National Solar Mission. MLA Surinder Thakur said that Uttarakhand has started attracting more investment in the power sector, and therefore, stalled hydel projects must be completed soon. Members also said that Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) is reluctant to return some land to the state government. Irrigation in Bilaspur MLA Subhash Thakur raised the issue of lack of irrigation schemes near the Gobind Sagar reservoir in Bilaspur. The irrigation minister said that a reservoir which can make use of overflowing water both from the Gobind Sagar and Ali Khad has been planned and it can provide irrigation as well as drinking water to farmers and residents of the area.","During the final day of the Winter session of the Himachal Pradesh Vidhan Sabha in Tapovan, members reviewed the state's ongoing programs, including the 'Jan Manch' initiative, hydel and solar power projects, and irrigation schemes near the Gobind Sagar Lake. The session, which lasted 28 hours and 50 minutes, saw heated discussions on various issues. The debate on the 'Jan Manch' program, initiated two years ago by the state government, divided the House. BJP MLA Sukh Ram praised the program for delivering essential services to the public at their doorstep, citing the resolution of 39,566 out of 43,286 complaints. He emphasized its success in resolving issues like water connections, pension applications, and public toilets. Other members, however, criticized it as a waste of public funds, with claims that many problems were deliberately delayed so they could be addressed during the program. Kinnaur MLA Jagat Negi and Theog MLA Rakesh Singha accused the government of using 'Jan Manch' as a political tool, undermining officers and humiliating them in front of the public. Palampur MLA Ashish Butail recounted a tragic incident of a woman who died after her complaint about water-logging was not promptly addressed. Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur defended the initiative, saying it aimed to reduce public footfall in government offices and make services more accessible to citizens. He noted that this program was unique in the country, allowing people to voice their grievances publicly. The session also saw discussions on energy projects. The CM highlighted Himachal's contribution of 11,000 megawatts to the power sector, with a focus on expanding hydel and solar projects under the National Solar Mission. MLA Surinder Thakur urged the completion of stalled hydel projects, pointing out that neighboring Uttarakhand had attracted more investment in the sector. Irrigation issues were raised by MLA Subhash Thakur, who highlighted the lack of irrigation schemes near the Gobind Sagar reservoir.

High Court can decide on Rajasthan disqualification issue: SC,"In a setback to the Congress party, the Supreme Court on Thursday refused to stop the Rajasthan High Court from pronouncing its decision on Friday on a petition by 19 rebel MLAs led by sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot against the Speaker’s disqualification notices given to them for defying the party. A Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra while refusing to stay the HC proceedings, however, said that the HC’s decision will be subject to the final orders of the apex court. It also questioned as to why the Speaker, a neutral person, should approach the court at all. “It is the matter of just one day. Why can’t you wait,” the judges said. “Can a person elected by people not express his dissent? Assume a leader has lost the faith of persons. While remaining in the party they cannot be disqualified. Then this will become a tool and no one can raise their voice. The voice of dissent cannot be suppressed. In a democracy, can somebody be shut down like this?” Justice Arun Misha told senior counsel Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the Rajasthan Assembly Speaker CP Joshi. Posting the matter for further hearing on Monday, the judges said, “We will only hear the question whether the court can interfere with the Speaker’s proceedings or not. We will not go into whether the Speaker acted mala fide or bona fide. We cannot go into that.” Joshi had on Wednesday moved the top court against the HC’s order that restrained him till July 24 from deciding the disqualification notices he had issued to the group of 19 rebel MLAs led by Pilot. The HC had also restrained the Speaker from conducting disqualification proceedings against the dissidents. Sibal argued that the presiding officer’s right to call and conduct the disqualification proceeding cannot be meddled with by the court; at most the speaker can be asked to rule upon the proceedings within a time frame. He said the issue as to whether the disqualification process is permissible or not cannot be taken note of by the court at this stage. “Our grievance is purely constitutional and there cannot be any order till decision is taken by the Speaker,” he argued, adding that courts could only intervene when the Speaker takes a decision to suspend or disqualify a member of the House. The Pilot camp, represented by senior counsel Harish Salve, argued that if a group of MLAs “raise their voices against style of functioning of the Chief Minister, that is not defection.” “Defection is when you leave Party A and joint Party B. Protesting against the party while staying within the party cannot be regarded as giving up party membership,” the senior lawyer said, adding that “intra-party dissent however shrill it may be, until the moment it goes to the extent of supporting another party, cannot be a ground to even start disqualification proceedings under Tenth schedule of the Constitution.” He further said that the party whip applied only when the Assembly is in session and issuing such a notice is a violation of their freedom of expression. The Speaker had served disqualification notices to 19 rebel MLAs including Sachin Pilot for “anti-party activities” after they skipped two meetings of Congress MLAs. The Congress party had complained and had accused the rebel lawmaker of trying to topple the Ashok Gehlot government. Pilot was also sacked as deputy chief minister and the president of the state unit of the party after he rebelled against Gehlot.","The Supreme Court declined to halt the Rajasthan High Court's decision on Friday regarding the disqualification notices issued to 19 rebel MLAs by the Speaker. While refusing to stay the HC proceedings, the SC stated that the HC's decision would be subject to its final orders. The bench questioned why the Speaker should approach the court, emphasizing the importance of dissent in a democracy. Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, representing the Speaker, argued that the court should not interfere with the Speaker's proceedings. However, Harish Salve, representing the rebel MLAs, contended that dissent within a party should not lead to disqualification unless it involves supporting another party.

"Production is like having a baby , says Madhuri Dixit","Mumbai: With her million dollar smile, Madhuri Dixit continues to rule the hearts of her fans. At 51, the actress has no time to take a backseat in her career. And, in between acting, Madhuri has now ventured into production with a Marathi film 15 August. Set in a Mumbai chawl, the actress along with her husband Sriram Nene has decided to release the film on Netflix. Sharing her first-hand experience on production, she reveals that production is way more difficult than acting. “Acting is like you are done for the day after pack up but producing is like having a baby. From conception to its release in the theatres, it is like literally having a baby. It is like raising a child and you don’t know how it’s going to turn out,” she says and adds, “As an actor, it’s not easy but my responsibility ends as the day ends. I go home and I chill. But, for a producer, he cannot get out the character, he has to be with the film throughout. It’s a little more difficult and it’s a different challenge.” So, how well verse is Madhuri with the production work? “I won’t say that I know everything about production because that’s not my forte. I am more of a creative person. So, for me hearing the script is more of my job. The actual producer’s hat is donned by my husband. When you work here (in the film industry) for too long, we don’t think out of the box and sometimes he comes up with some ideas that make me think that we can also do it this way.” Adding to this, her husband says, “My value addition is that I am not from the industry. So, I can look at things differently and come up with a unique solution. It’s hard sometimes because everyone is so occupied. So, I would say the celebration of this one is a real team effort.” While a lot of adult content is shown in the digital space, Madhuri wants to stick to her family audience. “It also depends on who is producing it, what is your subject and which network is carrying it. We cannot answer for others but as far as we are concerned, we are more into the family entertainer zone. We don’t like to put in anything unnecessarily, it has to be relatable and respectful to the audience,” she concludes.",Madhuri Dixit on producing a film and why it is more challenging than acting.,Entertainment,2019-03-28 00:00:00

BackBack Narendra Modi releases 100 secret files on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday released the first set of 100 digitised files relating to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in the public domain, the freedom icon who created the Indian National Army to throw off the shackles of British colonial rule in India. The declassification of the documents is widely expected to reveal the truth behind the disappearance of Bose seven decades ago. Saturday also happens to be the 119th birth anniversary of Bose. Modi also met family members of Netaji, including Prof. Chitra Ghosh, Shri Chandra Bose, and Shri Surya Kumar Bose, a government statement said. Two commissions of inquiry had concluded that Bose died in a plane crash in Taipei on 18 August 1945. A third commission of inquiry and many people, including some of his relatives, have contested that theory. Modi had, in his meeting with members of the Bose family in October, conveyed to them that the government would declassify the files relating to the leader. “There are some 33 files which the prime minister’s office had in its possession related to Netaji and these have been transferred to the National Archives. Different ministries of the government were also told to transfer whatever files they had in their possession to the National Archives"" said an official adding the number of files released were about 100. “Remembering Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his birth anniversary. His bravery & patriotism endears him to several Indians across generations,"" Modi said earlier in a post on Twitter. “Today is a special day for all Indians. Declassification of Netaji files starts today. Will go to National Archives myself for the same,"" he said in another post. There are some other theories about Netaji’s disappearance, one of them being that the leader fled to the former Soviet Union to continue to fight for India’s independence but was later killed. The other says that Netaji returned to India as an ascetic, ‘Gumnami Baba’, and continued to live in Uttar Pradesh’s Faizabad till 1985. Netaji’s daughter Anita Bose Pfaff, who currently lives in Germany, however believes that her father had died in the Taipei plane crash of 1945. In an interview published in the Hindustan Times on Friday, Pfaff said that her “personal belief"" was that her father “died in the plane crash."" A museum in Kolkata dedicated to Bose preserves memories of the leader. Its walls are lined with black and white photos of Bose’s parents, of him as a young boy, his May 1942 meeting with Germany’s then leader Adolf Hitler in Berlin and a picture of his German wife, Emilie Schenkl, holding baby Anita. Other pictures capture his 90-day journey from Germany to Japan aboard a submarine between February and May 1943. Another is allegedly the last known picture of Bose, in which he is seen stepping off a plane in Saigon on 17 August 1945, a day before his widely disputed death in an aircrash in Taipei.","On 23 January, 119 years to the day after the birth of one of India’s national heroes, the country’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, released the first batch of 33 digitised files relating to the life of Subhas Chandra Bose. Two further batches are due to be released in due course and it is expected that Bose’s family will call for a public investigation of the files as they suspect foul play in the leader’s 1945 death.

China manufacturing at 5-yr high,"BEIJING: Chinese manufacturing expanded by the most in five years in December, supporting estimates that growth has accelerated to more than 10 per cent in the world’s third- biggest economy. A purchasing managers’ index rose to a seasonally adjusted 56.1, HSBC Holdings and Markit Economics said. The measure is based on a survey of more than 400 manufacturing companies. Want a Loan? Get cash against your Mutual Funds in 4 hours Liu Mingkang, China’s top banking regulator, said on Monday that while asset bubbles are a threat, banks have “more than” enough capital and should extend loans to consumers and smaller businesses to sustain growth. “China’s economy is continuing a V-shaped recovery and economic growth may have quickened to 11 per cent in the fourth quarter,” said Sun Mingchun, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings. in Hong Kong. “There are early signs that the economy may be entering an overheating stage,” he added, citing rising raw-material costs and company inventories at high levels. India’s manufacturing also grew at a faster pace last month, a survey released today by HSBC and Markit showed, and the US is likely to report an acceleration, economists’ forecasts showed ahead of the release of the Institute for Supply Management’s factory index. Yuan forwards climb In China, yuan forwards advanced on speculation policy makers will allow the currency to resume appreciation this year. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.2 per cent to 6.6495 per dollar as of 1:03 pm local time. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.4 per cent. Bonds were little changed. China’s economy may have expanded 10.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2009, according to the median estimate of economists, and Sun forecasts 10.5 per cent growth this year. Central bank adviser Fan Gang cautioned November 18 that a “double- digit” gain wouldn’t be good in 2010 amid the rising risk of bubbles in stock, real estate and commodity prices. Inflation may become “an increasing focus” for China’s officials and “the case for tighter policy, including a stronger currency, is likely to build in coming months,” said Brian Jackson, a Hong Kong-based strategist on emerging markets at Royal Bank of Canada.Consumer prices climbed 0.6 per cent in November from a year earlier, snapping a nine-month run of deflation. Retail sales in 1,000 stores rose 17.5 per cent in the first three days of 2010 from a year earlier, the Ministry of Commerce said today. Premier Wen Jiabao said on December 27 that China will “absolutely not yield” to pressure for currency gains as the nation holds the yuan at about 6.83 per dollar. Today’s PMI number was the highest since April 2004, the first month of the HSBC survey. The official PMI, which was released on January 1 and has a different methodology, showed the biggest expansion in 20 months. In the studies, a number above 50 indicates an expansion. Output prices rose at the fastest pace since July 2008 as companies reported rising costs for raw materials including steel, aluminum, coal and petroleum, HSBC said. A $586 billion stimulus package, subsidies for consumer purchases and record new loans have driven the nation’s recovery from the slowest growth in almost a decade. ‘Structural bubbles’ Liu wrote in an opinion piece in Bloomberg News today that banks shouldlend to “boost consumer spending, support rural development and qualified small and medium-sized enterprises, improve health care and the socialsecurity system, and facilitate pollution reduction and energy saving.” He cautioned that the economy faces challenges including weak export demand and the threat of “structural bubbles.” China’s leaders pledged last month to maintain stimulus and keep a “moderate loose” monetary policy to cement a recovery, after the economy grew at the fastest pace in a year in the third quarter, expanding 8.9 per cent. Industrial companies’ profits rose 7.8 per cent in the first 11 months of last year to a record 2.59 trillion yuan ($379 billion), the statistics bureau said last month. Wuhan Iron & Steel Group, China’s third-biggest steelmaker, plans to boost production by 24 per cent this year to meet rising demand from automakers, home-appliance manufacturers and builders. Skyworth Digital Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong-listed television maker, said on December 2 that profit jumped 530 percent in the six months ended Sept. 30 as Chinese government subsidies spurred appliance sales.","Chinese manufacturing experienced its most significant expansion in five years in December, with a Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rising to 56.1, according to a report by HSBC Holdings and Markit Economics. This surge supports estimates that China's economy, the world's third-largest, has accelerated to more than 10% growth. The robust PMI figure is based on a survey of over 400 manufacturing firms, indicating broad-based growth across the sector. China's economic recovery, characterized as V-shaped, has prompted optimism among economists like Sun Mingchun of Nomura Holdings, who forecasts growth of around 11% in the fourth quarter. However, concerns over potential overheating are emerging due to escalating raw material costs and high company inventories. The yuan's forwards also strengthened amid speculation that policymakers might allow the currency to appreciate further this year. Despite these positive economic indicators, there are cautionary notes regarding inflation, with consumer prices registering a 0.6% increase year-on-year in November, ending nine months of deflation. Government measures including a substantial stimulus package and increased lending have bolstered China's recovery from its slowest growth in nearly a decade. However, challenges such as weak export demand and the emergence of ""structural bubbles"" in sectors like real estate and commodities remain critical issues for policymakers. Overall, while China's manufacturing and economic indicators are showing robust growth, managing inflation and sustaining balanced economic expansion will be key priorities moving forward.",International News,2010-01-05 00:00:00
"Right-wing group objects to screening of film at National Film Archive of India, says it showed Indian Army in bad light","The incident took place on Sunday when the docudrama, titled 'I Am Not The River Jhelum', was being screened as part of ‘A Festival of Contemporary Indian Films’ organised by the Pune International Centre and the International Federation of Film Critics-India Chapter Members of a right-wing organisation barged into the National Film Archive of India (NFAI) premises in Maharashtra's Pune city objecting to the screening of a docudrama, claiming it showed the Indian Army in a bad light, a police official said. The incident took place on Sunday when the docudrama, titled 'I Am Not The River Jhelum', was being screened as part of ‘A Festival of Contemporary Indian Films’ organised by the Pune International Centre and the International Federation of Film Critics-India Chapter.

The protesters, belonging to Samast Hindu Bandhav Sanghatana, were detained and released after being issued notices under the Maharashtra Police Act, 1951, the official said. Ravindra Padwal, president of the right-wing organisation, said they objected to the film after learning that some of the scenes in it showed the Indian Army in Kashmir in a bad light. “Some people who were in the audience informed us about such a portrayal of the Army in the film. By the time we reached there, the movie was about to get over. We objected to the scenes and raised slogans in support of the Army,” said Padwal. He said they demanded the director show them the docudrama and explain his side. When they were discussing the matter with the organisers, the police came and took them to a police station, said Padwal. “Even if people follow a certain ideology, be it progressive or regressive, they should be proud of the Indian Army. If the director has projected the Indian Army in a bad light, it amounts to sedition and an offence should be registered against him,” he said. The festival was held from February 9 to 11, during which many award-winning films in Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, Manipuri-Tangkhul, Rajasthani-Hindi, and Khasi-Jaintia-Garo-Hindi were screened, said the organisers.

"Drug for diabetes slows Parkinson’s onset, study shows","Washington : A drug used to treat diabetes slowed the progression of motor issues associated with Parkinson’s disease, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine said on Wednesday. Parkinson’s is a devastating nervous system disorder affecting 10 million people worldwide, with no current cure. Symptoms include rhythmic shaking known as tremors, slowed movement, impaired speech and problems balancing, which get worse over time. Researchers have been interested in exploring a class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists — which mimic a gut hormone and are commonly used to treat diabetes and obesity —for their potential to protect neurons. So far however, evidence of clinical benefits in patients has been limited and early studies have proved inconclusive. In the new paper, 156 patients with early-stage Parkinson’s were recruited across France and then randomly chosen to receive either lixisenatide, which is sold under the brand names Adlyxin and Lyxumia and made by Sanofi, or a placebo. After one year of follow up, the group on the treatment, which is given as an injection, saw no worsening of their movement symptoms, while those on the placebo did. The effect was “modest” according to the paper, and was noticeable only when assessed by professionals “who made them do tasks; walking, standing up, moving their hands, etc” senior author Olivier Rascol, a neurologist at Toulouse University, told AFP. But, he added, this may just be because Parkinson’s disease worsens slowly, and with another year of follow up, the differences might become much starker. “This is the first time that we have clear results, which demonstrate that we had an impact on the progression of the symptoms of the disease and that we explain it by a neuroprotective effect,” said Rascol. Gastrointestinal side effects were common on the drug and included nausea, vomiting and reflux, while a handful of patients experienced weight loss. Both Rasol and co-author Wassilios Meissner, a neurologist at Bordeaux University Hospital, both stressed more study would be required to confirm safety and efficacy before the treatment should be given to patients. Michael Okun, medical director of the Parkinson’s Foundation, told AFP that from a practical standpoint, the differences in patient outcomes were not clinically significant, but “statistically and compared to other studies, this type of difference should draw our interest and attention.” “Experts will likely argue whether this study meets a minimum threshold for neuroprotection, and it likely does not,” continued Okun, adding the weight loss side effect was concerning for Parkinson’s patients.","A study in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that a diabetes drug, lixisenatide, may slow Parkinson's disease progression. After a year, patients on the drug showed no worsening of symptoms compared to those on a placebo. However, gastrointestinal side effects and weight loss raise concerns, warranting further research.",Opinion and Editorial,2024-04-05 00:00:00
Places of Worship Act must be reviewed,"The Places of Worship Act, as a legislative instrument, must evolve to meet the challenges of the present while honouring the historical tapestry The recent green-lighting of a survey of the Shahi Eidgah in Mathura by the Allahabad High Court has re-ignited a longstanding debate over the Places of Worship Act 1991. Amid escalating disputes mirroring the complexities seen in the Varanasi Gyanvapi case, the focus shifts to the legal framework designed to maintain the religious status quo – the Places of Worship Act. This trend is not limited only to Varanasi and Mathura. Hindu organizations also filed petitions demanding they should be allowed to offer prayers at Quwwatul Islam mosque in the Qutub Minar premises in New Delhi, while another Hindu organization claimed the Taj Mahal as the Tajo Mahal temple of Lord Shiva and asked for the court’s permission to offer prayers there. This was visible in Soth too, Vishwa Hindu Parishad volunteers demanded they should be allowed to offer prayers on the outskirts of Mangaluru after a Hindu temple-like architectural design was purportedly found there underneath the Juma Masjid on April 21, 2022. The VHP claimed that the mosque was built atop Sri Ramanjaneya Bhajana Mandira. Prohibitory orders were imposed in the city after Hindu organizations said they would organize 'Tambula Prashne' at Sri Ramanjaneya Bhajana Mandira. The legal battle is the latest instance of a growing phenomenon in which Hindu groups petitioning courts demanding land where mosques are located by claiming these belong to Hindus. These petitions question the Places of Worship Act putting the Government and Judiciary in a tight spot. Enacted against the backdrop of the Ram Janmabhoomi Movement, the Act has played a crucial role in preserving religious harmony in the country. However, the recent surge in disputes, notably in Mathura and Varanasi, raises pertinent questions about the efficacy and current validity of this legislative measure. The Places of Worship Act passed in 1991, emerged from the turbulent period leading up to its enactment, marked by fervent communal tensions, notably centred around the Ayodhya dispute. The legislation was conceived as a pivotal step towards preventing similar fractious litigations and safeguarding the social fabric of the nation. The core principle of the Places of Worship Act is to freeze the religious status of all places of worship as they existed on August 15, 1947. The Act categorically exempts the Ayodhya dispute, acknowledging its unique historical and emotional significance. The explicit intent was to prevent litigation that could potentially disturb the communal equilibrium. Recent legal battles in Mathura and Varanasi have seen litigants invoking the 1991 Act, emphasizing its role in protecting the sanctity of religious places. In the Mathura case, Hindu groups claim that the Shahi Eidgah was constructed on land belonging to the Sri Krishna Janambhoomi Trust, demanding the removal of the mosque and the return of the land to the Trust. The Varanasi dispute, on the other hand, revolves around claims by Hindu groups regarding the Gyanvapi mosque. The efficacy of the Places of Worship Act is now under scrutiny as disputes continue to emerge, challenging the very essence of the legislation. One key challenge lies in the interpretation and application of the freeze date – August 15, 1947. Critics argue that freezing the religious character of places of worship at a specific historical moment may not account for the evolving social fabric and religious demographics of the nation over time. Moreover, the Act faces criticism for its seeming inability to address disputes arising from historical grievances, such as the alleged demolition of temples during medieval times. The Mathura case, where petitioners claim that the Katra Keshav Dev Temple was demolished by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, brings this historical dimension to the forefront. The Allahabad High Court's decision to allow a survey of the Shahi Eidgah in Mathura has opened a Pandora's Box, potentially setting a precedent for similar disputes across the country. The survey, akin to the one ordered for the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi, aims to verify claims made by Hindutva groups regarding the historical positioning of these places of worship. In both instances, the survey results have the potential to reshape the narrative, either affirming the claims of the Hindu groups or challenging them. The complex intertwining of historical accounts, archaeological evidence, and religious sentiments underscores the gravity of these disputes. The Legal Labyrinth: Pending Proceedings and Confusion Amidst the evolving legal landscape, a multitude of cases and petitions in various courts further complicate the scenario. Eighteen separate pleas in Mathura alone seek full ownership of the disputed 13.37-acre land by the temple management. The consolidation of these pleas by the high court adds a layer of complexity to an already convoluted legal web. Complicating matters further is the reluctance of the Union Government to clearly articulate its stance on the Places of Worship Act. The ongoing ambiguity raises concerns about the government's commitment to either uphold, review or scrap the legislation. The lack of a definitive position exacerbates the confusion surrounding the legal framework and its applicability in present times. In this undesirable situation, the onus is on the government to provide clarity on its position regarding the Places of Worship Act. The Supreme Court, being the ultimate arbiter, must expedite proceedings on the validity and interpretation of the Act in the context of evolving disputes. The potential consequences of leaving these issues unaddressed are far-reaching. Without a swift resolution, the legal ambiguity surrounding the Places of Worship Act could lead to the reemergence of similar disputes, perpetuating communal tensions and compromising the very fabric of our social harmony. The government's hesitancy to take a decisive stand and the prolonged proceedings before the top court contribute to a sense of uncertainty. A proactive approach, both from the government and the judiciary, is imperative to prevent further deterioration of the situation. As the legal quagmire unfolds, striking a delicate balance between historical grievances and the imperative of maintaining communal harmony becomes paramount. The Places of Worship Act, while a well-intentioned measure to prevent communal discord, needs careful reevaluation to address contemporary challenges and ensure its continued relevance in a dynamically evolving society. The nation awaits a judicious resolution that upholds the principles of justice, fairness, and social cohesion. In the labyrinth of legal complexities, it is essential to recognize that the preservation of religious harmony and historical justice need not be mutually exclusive. A nuanced and inclusive approach is required to navigate these intricate contours, acknowledging the diverse tapestry of India's cultural and religious heritage. The Places of Worship Act, as a legislative instrument, must evolve to meet the challenges of the present while honouring the historical tapestry that defines our nation. Only through a harmonious blend of legal clarity, historical understanding, and a commitment to social cohesion can we ensure a future where our places of worship stand as symbols of unity rather than sources of division.","The recent survey approval of Shahi Eidgah in Mathura by the Allahabad High Court has reignited debates around the Places of Worship Act 1991. Similar disputes in Varanasi and elsewhere highlight challenges to this legislation designed to maintain religious status quo. The Act, formed amidst the Ayodhya dispute, aims to freeze religious statuses as of August 15, 1947, exempting Ayodhya. Recent cases challenge this Act's efficacy due to evolving demographics and historical grievances. Legal battles in Mathura and Varanasi raise questions about the Act's interpretation and handling of historical claims. The pending proceedings, government ambiguity, and the judiciary's pace add complexity, demanding a definitive stance to prevent communal tensions. Balancing historical justice and communal harmony is crucial; the Act needs revisiting to navigate these complexities while honoring our nation's historical tapestry.",National News,2023-12-22 00:00:00

India launches a ‘Climate Equity Monitor’ on first day of COP26,"On the first day of the climate change conference, COP26, India launched an online dashboard – the ‘Climate Equity Monitor’ for assessing, at the international level, equity in climate action, inequalities in emissions, energy and resource consumption across the world, and ongoing climate policies of several countries from the perspective of developing countries. The ‘Climate Equity Monitor’ is aimed at monitoring the performance of Annex-I Parties under the UNFCCC (comprising developed countries) based on the foundational principles of the Climate Convention, namely equity and the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC). The performance and policies of the Non Annex-I Parties (developing countries) will be also provided for comparison, a release from the Environment, Forests and Climate Change Ministry said. The performance here is the respective countries actions to cut down on carbon emissions as part of the climate actions that will collectively help restrict global temperature rise. Welcoming the going live of the website (https://climateequitymonitor.in) on global climate policy, India’s Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister, Bhupender Yadav, tweeted: “Climate Equity Monitor that focuses on equity and climate action from a data and evidence-based perspective will encourage a vigorous discussion on this crucial issue and engage experts from all countries.” He also congratulated the team that worked on this project, the release said. The website has been conceptualised and developed by independent researchers from India — the Climate Change Group at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF), Chennai, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Department at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS) Bengaluru, with other independent researchers. The MSSRF team was led by Senior Fellow, Climate Change, Professor T. Jayaraman, and the NIAS team by Associate Professor, Dr Tejal Kanitkar. In keeping with the latest scientific results of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that have underlined the importance of cumulative emissions and carbon budgets, the analysis will be anchored in these two concepts. The equitable sharing of the global carbon budget is the fundamental equity principle that will underpin the assessments that will progressively appear on the website. Existing “tracking” websites on climate policies are based in the global North and routinely do not address the crucial aspects of equity and differentiation. Other websites, according to the researchers, bury the key issues in complexities that are not transparently dealt with. “The developers of this dashboard have taken this initiative to build awareness, especially among the public of the global South, that climate action is a global collective action problem. The website is intended to debunk the narrative provided by many developed countries, and global non-government organizations that focus attention continually on what developing countries must do, constantly demanding greater commitment and action from them,” the release added. The website is expected to be a valuable tool for policy makers, public institutions, researchers, academics, students, and the general public from developing countries to keep equity and climate justice considerations clearly in view in their perspective. The website will also undergo constant upgradation with additional new material, including the addition of new areas such as climate finance, technology transfer and adaptation.","India launched the 'Climate Equity Monitor' on the first day of COP26, aimed at assessing international equity in climate action.

Banking stocks end in red as hopes of further rate cuts by RBI fade,"Bank stocks tanked on Monday as hopes faded away of a rate-cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its mid-quarter review of monetary policy 2012-13. The RBI kept key lending rates unchanged to control high inflation. The re-purchase rate remains unchanged at eight percent, which automatically keeps the reverse re-purchase rate at seven percent. The move assumes significance as the RBI was expected to cut these key rates that would have translated in lowering of interest being paid by consumers on their loans for consumer durables, homes or automobiles. Economic experts feel that the bearish consumer sentiment on account of high interest rates will continue.

Priyanka barefoot walk wows Rae Bareli,"It’s not everyday that they see a celebrity, if not a political leader, walking barefoot. But as Priyanka Gandhi covered about half-a-kilometre barefoot Monday in the scorching heat after her sandals broke during a padyatra in Rae Bareli, she left the onlookers mesmerised. The Congress workers sought to cash-in on the moment as they raised the slogan “Priyanka nahi aandhi hai, doosri Indira Gandhi hai” (She is a storm, and an another Indira Gandhi). Concentrating mainly on Muslim dominated areas and paying visit to the houses of known Muslim faces of Rae Bareli city on the last day of campaigning, Priyanka began her foot-march around 2:20 pm from central office of the party in the city. Advertisement As she took strides, akin to her grandmother and former prime minister Indira Gandhi, she gave a hard time to security officials, who had to push back the teeming crowd around her. After she had covered about one-and-a-half kilometres at Gulab road, someone accidentally stepped on her sandals and the strap came undone. As there were women waiting for her ahead, she took off her other sandal as well and walked bare-foot. As she kept moving, local youth Congress leaders went in search of new pair of sandals in the market. By the time one Rahul Bajpai found a new pair, she had walked another 500 mtrs bare-foot till Qila bazaar area. On her way, some leaders even tried to give her their footwear but she continued walking. She finally accepted an alternative pair of sandals from her aide Priti Sahay. As she stopped at shops, houses, crossings and especially at places where groups of women were standing, security personnel struggled to clear way for her.

"‘Cartels gone’, Hry auctions 60% liquor vending zones","Chandigarh: Having put 60% of liquor vends across Haryana under the hammer in the first round of e-auction for the next excise year, the excise and taxation department claims to have broken the cartel of major players of the state. According to information, in the first round of auction, which was held between May 26 to May 31, the department claims to have sold 731 out of 1,197 liquor zones and has assured the excise licence fee of Rs 5,181 crore against them so far. Officials feel that as 40% of stocks are yet to come under bid for the second time, the department is expecting to achieve its targeted revenue of Rs 13,000 crore in terms of revenue from excise. Alleging some drastic changes added with the increase of excise duty, the major players of the liquor industry in the state had threatened to stay away from vends. Officials claim that during the first round of auction they have been able to break the cartel. “Last time, the department had to conduct 18 rounds of actions to completely sell out all the zones. But this time, we are expecting to exhaust all zones by the next two rounds. We are hopeful of not only improving the transparency and revenue, but we shall maintain more checks on the flow of liquor into vends,’’ a senior official of the department said. According to information, during the auction held last year, the department had been able to sell off 731 vends for Rs 4,282 crore against Rs 5,181 crore of bid money for the current year.
